The only way to\nobtain those privileges is to become a system app.\n\nThis is where the Privileged Extension comes in - being a separate app\nand much smaller, it can be installed as a system app and communicate\nwith the main app via AIDL IPC.\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\n* Reduced disk usage in the system partition\n* System updates don't remove F-Droid\n* The process of installing into system via root is safer\n\nInstead of this build, most users will want to install the\n\"Over-The-Air\" (OTA) update ZIP file is called\nhttps://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota.  This is here to update\nPrivileged Extension when it has been installed using the OTA ZIP.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension"},"version":"1008525a17b4f6a93ac690f9c50dcb675b6bebf53d2879dbc98ba65a1cb2e28d","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
