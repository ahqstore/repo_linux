This app is currently in beta stage, not all features are\nimplemented, but the most important is. Feel free to test it and review it.\nIf you find a bug or have problems with this app, you can contact me with\nthe email provided on the GitHub page.\n\n<i>Sweet IPFS</i> targets end-users and developers in order to make IPFS (and\ndecentralization) an everyday standard. Its main goal is to be used as a\nfile sharing app. For that, it provides a file chooser, QR codes, and a\nbrowser. To go even faster, you can upload a file or a text directly from\nany app by simply sharing it and choosing <i>Sweet IPFS</i>.\n\nAt the current point, battery and network usage depends a lot on your phone\nand your Android version, and may be high. I am working on this in order to\nprovide the best experience and an everyday usage.","repo":{"author":"hazae41","repo":"https://github.com/RHazDev/Sweet-IPFS"},"version":"2ef5cd2520cb890a054baedd567802ea27eb3b935dfc92acab30a0feeacf255a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/RHazDev/Sweet-IPFS","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
