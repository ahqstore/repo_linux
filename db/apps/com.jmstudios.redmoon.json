Red Moon filters out blue light and dims your screen below the normal minimum, so you can use your phone comfortably at night.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Schedule Red Moon to run from sunset to sunrise, or at custom times.\n- Use the default color profiles, or set custom color, intensity, and dim levels.\n- Automatically pause in apps secured against overlays, or those you choose.\n- Quickly start, stop, and switch profiles via notification, tile (Android 7.0+), or widget.\n\nPermissions:\n\n- Modify system settings: To automatically lower the screen brightness when the filter is on\n- Approximate location (network-based): To determine the sunrise and sunset at your location. This will only be used when you configure Red Moon to automatically start at night.\n- Draw over other apps: To change the color and brightness of the screen in all apps\n- Run at startup: To restore the previous filter state at startup\n","repo":{"author":"Stephen Michel","repo":"https://github.com/LibreShift/red-moon"},"version":"c207ebf2533d50f13ba909c7a320be0e655154a91530efebc8f7dc5c27d5b52d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/LibreShift/red-moon","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
