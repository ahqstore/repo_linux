With built-in support for images, group chats and e2e encryption.\n\nDesign principles:\n\n* Be as beautiful and easy to use as possible without sacrificing security or privacy\n* Rely on existing, well established protocols\n* Do not require a Google Account or specifically Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)\n* Require as few permissions as possible\n\nFeatures:\n\n* End-to-end encryption with either <a href=\"http://conversations.im/omemo/\">OMEMO</a> or <a href=\"http://openpgp.org/about/\">OpenPGP</a>\n* Sending and receiving images\n* Encrypted audio and video calls (DTLS-SRTP)\n* Intuitive UI that follows Android Design guidelines\n* Pictures / Avatars for your Contacts\n* Syncs with desktop client\n* Conferences (with support for bookmarks)\n* Address book integration\n* Multiple accounts / unified inbox\n* Very low impact on battery life\n\nConversations makes it very easy to create an account on the free conversations.im server. However Conversations will work with any other XMPP server as well. A lot of XMPP servers are run by volunteers and are free of charge.\n\nXMPP Features:\n\nConversations works with every XMPP server out there. However XMPP is an extensible protocol. These extensions are standardized as well in so called XEPâ€™s. Conversations supports a couple of those to make the overall user experience better. There is a chance that your current XMPP server does not support these extensions. Therefore to get the most out of Conversations you should consider either switching to an XMPP server that does or - even better - run your own XMPP server for you and your friends.\n\nThese XEPs are - as of now:\n\n* XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams (or mod_proxy65). Will be used to transfer files if both parties are behind a firewall or NAT.\n* XEP-0163: Personal Eventing Protocol for avatars\n* XEP-0191: Blocking command lets you blacklist spammers or block contacts without removing them from your roster.\n* XEP-0198: Stream Management allows XMPP to survive small network outages and changes of the underlying TCP connection.\n* XEP-0280: Message Carbons which automatically syncs the messages you send to your desktop client and thus allows you to switch seamlessly from your mobile client to your desktop client and back within one conversation.\n* XEP-0237: Roster Versioning mainly to save bandwidth on poor mobile connections\n* XEP-0313: Message Archive Management synchronize message history with the server. Catch up with messages that were sent while Conversations was offline.\n* XEP-0352: Client State Indication lets the server know whether or not Conversations is in the background. Allows the server to save bandwidth by withholding unimportant packages.\n* XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload allows you to share files in conferences and with offline contacts. Requires an additional component on your server.\n","repo":{"author":"Daniel Gultsch","repo":"https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations"},"version":"eac81f8555af39469c64379b75000eab9d6eb9d125e94ad0afd6821df770aa41","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
