During this break do any other activities except for the previous work\n<li>Return to the work after the break (or not, if you've finished)\n<li>Take a long break about 10–30 minutes after every 4 work intervals\n</ul>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/\">Full Pomodoro® Technique description on the author's website</a>\n\nThe Minidoro app may help you in Pomodoro® Technique adoption! Minidoro has:\n<ul>\n<li>Minimalist user interface: only countdown screen with big digits, it's on all the time while timer's on\n<li>See only how much time left, no other distractions\n<li>It may turn Do-not-Disturb Mode in your device, no other apps will distract you\n<li>You may count your distractions, by yourself or by outside\n<li>You may set up your preferences: periods duration, long break frequency, notifications\n<li>Dark theme (the only)\n<li>No ads\n<li>Works on any Android device, phone, table or watch, you may utilize even your old smartphone\n<li>Proper work on Samsung® phones and tables (<a href=\"https://dontkillmyapp.com\">https://DontKillMyApp.com</a> is not applicable)\n</ul>\n\n<b>Wear OS notice</b>\n\nIt would be a great feature that Minidoro running on Wear OS turns DnD mode on both Wear OS and Android device. It should be generally possible since Wear OS may turn DnD on Android devices. But there's one nuisance. It's not possible to allow any app to operate DnD Mode in Wear OS from Wear OS UI. The only way to allow Minidoro to operate DnD in Wear OS is ADB command (no root should be needed).\n\nInstall Minidoro, turn Wear OS in debug mode and connect to computer.\n\nAfter that for Wear OS 2.2 (based on Android 9) and above run this: \"adb shell cmd notification allow_listener com.github.ympavlov.minidoro/com.github.ympavlov.minidoro.dnd.DndModeServiceV21\"\n\nFor any other Wear OS version below (based on Android 8.1 and below) use this: \"adb shell settings put secure enabled_notification_listeners com.google.android.wearable.app/com.google.android.clockwork.stream.NotificationCollectorService:com.github.ympavlov.minidoro/com.github.ympavlov.minidoro.dnd.DndModeServiceV21\"\n\n\n\nPomodoro® is a registered trademark Francesco Cirillo.
