It helps with repeating tasks, such as meditation.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, it is a simpler version of Foto Timer, and a rewrite of the original Meditation Timer for PalmOS from 20 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation Timer is working with \"processes\", which define how Meditation Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be \"chained\" together, meaning that a process can automatically lauch another.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation Timer contains absolutely no AI whatsoever.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/jexner/MeditationTimerAndroid"},"version":"d1b575d64106f6359a80bf0040d73b0fcd44736347291c8a9e30d21f9752498b","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/jexner/MeditationTimerAndroid","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
