This restriction can lead to issues, such as apps displaying incorrect characters due to Han unification, where characters in one language may appear in another. For example, without Japanese added as a locale, apps may show Chinese characters instead of Japanese ones.\n","repo":{"author":"Nightdavisao","repo":"https://github.com/Nightdavisao/MultiLocale"},"version":"366a781966004f2b4c933e45a5da8b280205931b0471b63e9dd69cca8c712345","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Nightdavisao/MultiLocale","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
