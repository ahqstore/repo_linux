Using AutoEQ integration, you can search and import frequency responses that aim to correct your headphone to a neutral sound. Go to 'Arbitrary response equalizer > Magnitude response > AutoEQ profiles' to get started.\n\n--- Limitations\n* Apps blocking internal audio capture remain unprocessed (e.g., Spotify, Google Chrome)\n* Apps using some types of HW-accelerated playback may cause issues and need to be manually excluded (e.g., some Unity games)\n* Cannot coexist with (some) other audio effect apps (e.g., Wavelet and other apps that make use of the `DynamicsProcessing` Android API)\n\n\n- Apps confirmed working:\n* YouTube\n* YouTube Music\n* Amazon Music\n* Deezer\n* Poweramp\n* Substreamer\n* Twitch\n* ...\n\n- Unsupported apps include:\n* Spotify (Note: Spotify ReVanced patch is required to support Spotify)\n* Google Chrome\n* SoundCloud\n* ...\n\n--- Translation\nPlease help us translate this app here: https://crowdin.com/project/rootlessjamesdsp\nTo request a new language that isn't enabled on Crowdin yet, please open an issue here on GitHub and I will turn it on.\n","repo":{"author":"Tim Schneeberger","repo":"https://github.com/ThePBone/RootlessJamesDSP"},"version":"ceeeb3fe449cca85e52a8e8ce9cff11a18ae92deb2d59c2937c9cbee8e7937f4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ThePBone/RootlessJamesDSP","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
