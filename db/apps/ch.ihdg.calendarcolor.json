Tested with\ncalendars provided by baikal.\n\n<b>Kown Issues:</b>\n\nThe color is slightly different from what the google calendar app is showing.\nThe google calendar app seems to tweak the colors a little bit. Colors set in\nowncloud are also slightly different in the google calendar app.\n\nThe colorchanges back after some time: Many calendar services will overwrite the\ncolor when syncing. Set the color directly in the service (e.g. google,\nowncloud) instead.\n\n<b>Thanks:</b>\n\nHoloColorPicker - <a href=\"https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker\">https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/pascalfree/calendar-color"},"version":"8caf4b679367331c2a8bf20c0216a634218a6d1cbc0e3d59eee9ec8eb345d917","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/pascalfree/calendar-color","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
