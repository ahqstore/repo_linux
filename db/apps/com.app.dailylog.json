Want to build a custom habit tracker? Do you follow a template for every journal entry? dailyLog can help.\n\ndailyLog works by accessing a single text file of your choosing: keeping your data on your device and accessible in any app you choose. But unlike a blank text file, dailyLog lets you define custom shortcut buttons. Imagine a workout log where tapping the \"chest\" button pastes \"chest press: reps, lbs\", allowing you to log your workouts with ease. Or imagine a journal where the \"üìù\" button pastes a list of questions you want to answer every day.\n\nInitially designed as a rapid logging system for journaling, dailyLog allows you to quickly add info to a text file with customizable button shortcuts.
