(28 and below users need to apply for storage permissions to access and store photos)\nAnd of course there are no stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with us >_<).\nWe're forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence. What's yours is yours.\n- Layout: support for horizontal and vertical intervals between the watermark, automatically repeat the full picture.\n- Style: font color, transparency, size and rotation angle can be adjusted.\n- Content: Support text watermark and image watermark.\n\n## Use\nYou can use it however you want. It is more suitable for situations where you need to submit a photo ID, a hand-held photo ID or a sensitive photo. Example.\n\nVarious real names in the country, uploading front and back photos of ID cards at every turn, even handheld ID photos.\nPre-project previews, samples, copyrighted or simply spoofed images\nReference text.\n\nThis photo is for xx for xxx purposes only, no other use.\n\nYou can turn down the transparency, just don't block the key information.\n\n(For now) we can't (temporarily) prevent information from being uploaded, or even (temporarily) prevent information from being leaked, but we can reduce the value of the information being leaked.\n\nEven if it's (probably) useless in the end, at least you can disgust the leaker a bit.\n\n## UI\nDesigned by renowned UI guru @tovi (👏🤪)\nAnything you think doesn't work well is my UI restore that doesn't work, and has nothing to do with the UI draft. xD\nThis app was designed by @tovi, so all rights to the UI and related design resources belong to him and may not be used without permission from any person or organization.\n\n## Open Source License.\nThird party libraries used.\n\ndaniel-stonuk/material-about-library\nskydoves/ColorPickerView\nmaterial-components/material-components-android\n\n## Feedback and contribution\nWe welcome your comments and suggestions in the issues section, or you can contribute your code by submitting a PR directly to us.
