For example, a game translated from Japanese to English. You download the patch containing the translation. It must be applied to the Japanese version to make an English version of it.\n\nThis program will not help you hack native Android games, it was created for the old console games (SNES, PS1, GBA, N64, SMD\\Genesis etc.)\n\nFeatures:\n* Supported formats of patches: IPS, IPS32, UPS, BPS, APS (GBA), APS (N64), PPF, DPS, EBP, XDelta3\n* Create XDelta patches\n* Fix the checksum in SMD\\Genesis ROMs\n* Remove the SMC header from SNES ROMs\n\nHow to use?\nYou have to select a ROM file, a patch and choose which file to save, then click on the red round button. Files are selected through the standard Files application (or through one of the file managers you have installed). The application will show a message when the file is patched. Do not close the application until the file is patched.\n\nVery important:\nIf the game and patch is compressed (ZIP, RAR, 7z or other), they first need to be unzipped.","repo":{"author":"Boris Timofeev","repo":"https://github.com/btimofeev/UniPatcher"},"version":"10d9dffe7118652b522235ccfaa0b92d01e7d04f612af478b3bb4b4888dd3c33","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/btimofeev/UniPatcher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
