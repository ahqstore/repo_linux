This is impossible.</p>\n<p>Instead, SuperFreezZ is honest about its disadvantages: Freezing daily used apps probably drains your battery a little faster. Also, these apps will take longer to start when you use them the next time: SuperFreezZ will super freeze your apps, it takes about 1-3 seconds to un-freeze them. Greenify has the same disadvantages, except that the author of Greenify does not warn you about it. So: Just do not overdo it, and SuperFreezZ will be super useful.</p>\n<p>Examples for apps that deserve to be frozen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Untrusted apps (that you do not want to run in the background)</li>\n<li>Apps you rarely use</li>\n<li>Annoying apps</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Optionally works without accessibility service as this slows down the device</li>\n<li>Can freeze only apps not used for a week (can be configured)</li>\n<li>Choose a white list (freeze all by standard) or a black list (do not freeze anything by standard)</li>\n<li>Can freeze apps when the screen goes off</li>\n<li>Options to freeze system apps and even SuperFreezZ itself</li>\n<li>Completely open source and free software</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"contributing-to-superfreezz\">Contributing to SuperFreezZ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"development\">Development</h3>\n<p>If you have a problem, question or an idea, just open an issue!</p>\n<p>If you would like to help with developing, have a look at the issues, or think of something that could be improved, and open an issue for it.</p>\n<p>Please tell me what you are going to do, to avoid implementing the same thing at the same time :-)</p>\n<h3 id=\"translate\">Translate</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/superfreezz/\">translate SuperFreezZ on Weblate</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"credits\">Credits</h2>\n<p>The code to show the app list is from <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/axp.tool.apkextractor\">ApkExtractor</a>.</p>\n<p>Robin Naumann made a nice intro.

A: There is none at all. If you hibernate an app with Greenify it will even be shown as frozen in SuperFreezZ and the other way round.</p>\n<p>Q: But the correct spelling would be “SuperFreeze”! A: I know.</p>\n<p>Q: Do you have any intentions to sell freezers? A: No.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/SuperFreezZ/SuperFreezZ"},"version":"a810afc11c16a856f5bf90f68b5d35b720a28cbbd22770db0e0298a0db00440c","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/SuperFreezZ/SuperFreezZ","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
