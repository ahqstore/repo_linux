Successfully jump from roof to roof, and watch your score soar!\n\nPlay through dozens of levels, or use your own MP3 files to generate custom worlds.\n\nNo ads. No in-game purchases. Just great music and fun times.\n\nEach level consists of obstacles that correspond to the music playing in the background. Every time you play the same level, the size of the obstacles will be the same, but the world will have a different style. No two sessions will look the same.\n\nAny feedback is very welcome at <a href=\"https://github.com/beat-game/beat-game/discussions\">GitHub</a>.\n\nPlease support further development at <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/pserwylo>GitHub sponsors</a> or <a href=\"https://liberapay.com/BeatFeet/\">Liberapay</a>.\n\nAnti-Features: NonFreeNet â€” additional levels are downloaded from a GitHub repo.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/beat-game/beat-game"},"version":"1f4a25e53bf8e85bce04489f98d9a2c86a3cdb9a36a34433f9dd78a60bf38467","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/beat-game/beat-game","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
