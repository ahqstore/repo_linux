It will be automatically updated as soon as you reopen it though. The app doesn't contains any history functionality (not yet at least).\n\n\nMade by TrianguloY. Extremely small, efficient, without any permissions, free and without ads.","repo":{"author":"TrianguloY","repo":"https://github.com/TrianguloY/SimpleClipboardEditor"},"version":"393e987d994cac79ab6c081da69f56769aeaa53e008b874ace4e33587a13941d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/TrianguloY/SimpleClipboardEditor","license_or_tos":"CC-BY-4.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
