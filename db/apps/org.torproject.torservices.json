It acts as a simple Tor \"provider\" for apps to hide their Internet traffic by encrypting it, then bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis. \n\nThis app is a complement to Orbot, which provides the full, \"batteries included\" Tor utility.\n","repo":{"author":"Guardian Project","repo":"https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/torservices"},"version":"6b8bb03af05cfc69b503dda511b0ffcc60a4777254eeee2c34ada2ba9e7c5769","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/torservices","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
