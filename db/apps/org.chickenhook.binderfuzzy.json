You can validate if system services have correct error handling or transfer binder objects / tokens of other services in order to validate if the target system service validates binder arguments.\n\nThis Project covers following features:\n\n* Browse managers and binder interfaces.\n* Execute Fuzzy tasks\n* Configure argument lists for each parameter of the method to fuzz\n* Read logs of recent tasks\n* Use python3 cli (optional) to execute fuzzer from desktop.\n* Define fuzzer script and execute via cli\n\nEnjoy our App!","repo":{"author":"ChickenHook","repo":"https://github.com/ChickenHook/BinderFuzzy"},"version":"1d21b8068bacd2067d359dbf2b22150ac3402ee45bee58f5c172a519ba2cc2b1","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ChickenHook/BinderFuzzy","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
