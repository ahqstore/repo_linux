A data connection is required.\n\nThe actual data reported may vary between countries. Also, as RoadEagle needs to convert the data from different formats to TraFF, it may not be able to represent all traffic messages as intended by their creators.\n\nThis app receives requests from compatible apps (consumers) which may expose the device location (and, possibly, where you intend to travel). Because of the location information, consumer apps may refuse to send such requests to apps without location permission. This is the only thing RoadEagle uses this permission for; it will never request a location update. \n\nPhoto by Joanna Pędzich-Opioła | CC_BY 2.0\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/traffxml/roadeagle"},"version":"295123599ec0d9fe7830a658b19c0a64b03eb5d9122980b6499887e27c8ed235","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/traffxml/roadeagle","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
