SoundAura can also switch between an audio focus respecting mode, and a 'play in background' mode that ignores audio focus rules and allows SoundAura to play audio alongside other apps.","repo":{"author":"CliffracerMerchant","repo":"https://github.com/CliffracerMerchant/SoundAura"},"version":"cbbd83450006bcec6736b9e808c926ae2c0b3453f983d5c9dddcbf7c334e843f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/CliffracerMerchant/SoundAura","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
