A final number to be determined: Count the planks of the bridge ... Hey, where has the bridge gone?! It was replaced by a pipe beneath the ground. What now ...? Look up the logs for potential telephone jokers? No, then I'd rather draw a line in my map, where the final could be located given the formula and missing x ... But wait - Coordinate Joker will do it for you. Just enter the coordinate formulas and it will send the resulting waypoints to your preferred Geocaching app. With a bit of luck, one point will appear close to some path while the others may be far away. Then where would you look for the final? :)","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/siggel/coordinatejoker"},"version":"0e317443dfa38884a235b72991ae632645cc977ad4e00afc050ef9863d660c3c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/siggel/coordinatejoker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
