System-managed notifications also allow this change.\nIn these cases, the application may be superfluous.</i>\n\nKeyboard Switcher is <b>opensource</b> and <b>ad-free</b>, it survives thanks to your contributions and donations.\n\nAny issue : <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher/issues\">https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher/issues</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Kunzisoft","repo":"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher"},"version":"98f848848e81dfb7c7cb0b2b0acbc27bc6c698bd71a9eb9061f4e3cf3ae7acf2","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
