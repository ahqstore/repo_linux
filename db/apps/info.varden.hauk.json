Meeting up with someone? Send them a Hauk link, and they can follow your location live on a map until you arrive to meet them.\n\nThis app requires that you have installed the Hauk backend on a server. Please see https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk for backend installation instructions.\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n* ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION - for getting your location, so that it can be shared\n* FOREGROUND_SERVICE - for keeping the share running when the app is minimized\n* INTERNET - for communicating with your Hauk backend server\n\nHauk does not share your location data to anywhere except the Hauk backend server you specify within the app. A unique link will be generated for your location share when you start sharing; anyone with this link will be able to see your location in real-time for as long as you are sharing.\n","repo":{"author":"Marius Lindvall","repo":"https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk"},"version":"0965ffda20c419c69b081d4848abdd7502a1e3801a2e30124e0369dd2051478e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
