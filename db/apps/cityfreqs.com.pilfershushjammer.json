But does NOT listen to or record any of the\naudio from the microphone. It uses 0% CPU and no noticeable battery use. However\nis not intended to be left on permanently due to the variety of triggers that\ncan cause audio_focus_state changes (VOIP etc).\n\nAlso features an <b>active jammer</b> that emits tones constrained to the NUHF\nrange of 18 kHz to 24 kHz range. User determined carrier frequency and drift\nlimits with rate for random tone emissions depending on the device capabilities.\nFor instance 20000 Hz carrier, drift limit 1000 Hz and rate slow - will output\nrandom frequency between 19 kHz and 21 kHz approximately every second.\n\nAudible artifacts are present during the NUHF tones but this may be changed in a\nfuture release. Experimental white noise output may not be very effective at\nblocking and is a somewhat annoying sound. The device speaker output may not\nhave enough amplitude to block unwanted NUHF signals - testing will determine.\n\n* Manual start\n* Notification post when running\n* Auto stop and restart when telephony interrupts\n* Currently relies on audio_focus_state changes for auto-switching\n* Active jammer","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/kaputnikGo/PilferShushJammer"},"version":"c7c04de887f3605cbf677389d7eea949acc245f59396396b8d8fe4359eaf041d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/kaputnikGo/PilferShushJammer","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
