If you pick the right answer you get points. If the answer is wrong you loose some. Also you can activate a timer for more pressure. You can activate the timer also in truth or dare and would you rather.\n\n<b>Different questions in Truth or dare:</b> In truth or dare you can add different questions for a different play feeling.\n\n<b>Please note</b> that this project is a <b>work in progress project.</b> This means that some questions may be missing, because they have not yet been added, even if the game itself would already work.\n\nMore <b>features</b> are added soon: https://codeberg.org/rm-rf/PartyGames/src/branch/master/ROADMAP.md","repo":{"author":"rm-rf","repo":"https://codeberg.org/rm-rf/PartyGames"},"version":"6dbe443d12cb3f1098a8c2af8502874c4d6679ec2bb4b0f495cd9d8b12afc261","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/rm-rf/PartyGames","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
