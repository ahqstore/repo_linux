It is a good way to access the Google webapps if you have\nan AOSP-based ROM and reject the proprietary GApps. Also the webapps are less\nbandwidth and battery-hungry than their native counterparts.\n\nLinks to external sites (such as news articles, etc.) will be opened in a\nregular browser, thus keeping the Google authentication sandboxed in the app.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/tobykurien/GoogleApps"},"version":"4abbca2dc1f913951e27d5f2cbde0e77fe8b99c75b3aba0c21d931f48f3703d8","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tobykurien/GoogleApps","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
