Simply confirm the download.\n* Check the \"Auto-update database\" checkbox in the menu (recommended) to automatically receive daily DB updates (these are incremental/delta updates, so they consume very little traffic).\n* Check the \"Block by rating\" checkbox to block calls with negative rating automatically.\n* You can also check the \"Use contacts\" checkbox if you want your contacts not to be treated as unknown callers.\n* After these steps everything should just work (but you can always find more options in Settings). Enjoy!\n\nSee <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/-/blob/master/FAQ.md\">frequently asked questions</a> to learn more.\n\nThe main phone number database is downloaded from <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker_data\">a gitlab repository</a>.\n<b>Database updates and detailed review queries are performed using 3rd-party servers.</b>\nNo user-identifiable information is sent (except for the phone number\nthe detailed reviews are loaded for).\n\nYet Another Call Blocker is still under development. Any help is welcome.\n\n''NonFreeNet:'' the 3rd-party service is not open source.\n","repo":{"author":"Xynngh","repo":"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/tree/HEAD"},"version":"6a6b8249d777c69b1a31338fc74ae48a6b47dfd874c40a893587c17a932baea3","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
