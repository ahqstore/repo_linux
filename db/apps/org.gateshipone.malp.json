Consider updating to the newest version.\n\nThis application has workarounds for Mopidy, it may or may not work. No support for Mopidy, as this is an MPD client.\n\nIf you don't know MPD and are looking for a music player for android, we recommend you have a look into Odyssey, which shares the same user interface with this application. ( https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gateshipone.odyssey/ )\n\nThe client implements most of the daemons functionality so that full media control and management is possible.\n\n\nTo filter albums this client uses the album artist tag (if available) to filter multiple albums with the same title (e.g. Greatest Hits)\n\nWe recommend that your music is tagged with musicbrainz library to get the best experience as the data tags are used to fetch artwork for artists and albums. \n\nFeatures:\n * Artist/Album/Files, saved playlist library browsing\n * AlbumArtist filtering\n * MBID filtering (multiple albums with same AlbumArtist and title can be accessed separately if MusicBrainzID is available)\n * Local  & server-based search\n * Basic playlist management (add songs to saved lists, remove songs from saved lists, remove lists, save lists)\n * Launcher widget\n * Optional notification (enable in settings)\n * Background volume control via hardware buttons (only with notification enabled)\n * Multiple server profiles\n * Server statistics (use this to request a database update)\n * Output control\n * Artwork support with MusicBrainz,Last.fm, Fanart.tv as artwork provider (Album, artist images)\n * Fanart view for tablets or stuff like that (click on the cover in the now playing view, or select fullscreen mode from menu), best used on widescreen devices in landscape mode.\n\nCover images shown on screenshots gratefully used with permission from Carbon Based Lifeforms ( http://carbonbasedlifeforms.net )\n\nThis software is free software, licensed under the GPLv3 or later license.
