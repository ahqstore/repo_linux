You only need one, probably for life, because it reveals\nNOTHING about you, and it's highly secure. It's just a very long (77-digit)\nrandom number.\n\nFrom then on, whenever you login with SQRL to a website, your private identity\nis used to generate another 77-digit number for that one website. Every website\nyou visit sees you as a different number, yet every time you return to the same\nsite, that site's unique number is regenerated.\n\nThis allows you to be uniquely and permanently identified, yet completely\nanonymous.\n\nSince you never need to use an eMail address or a password, you never give a\nwebsite your actual identity to protect. If the website's SQRL identities are\never stolen, not only would the stolen identities only be valid for that one\nwebsite, but SQRL's cryptography prevents impersonation using stolen identities.\n\nThis is as good as it sounds. It's what we've been waiting for.","repo":{"author":"Daniel Persson","repo":"https://github.com/kalaspuffar/secure-quick-reliable-login"},"version":"5e9b2d6390528c5c697f3831c79ac441124fd47f12ae8892c68d38b8e10c62d8","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/kalaspuffar/secure-quick-reliable-login","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
