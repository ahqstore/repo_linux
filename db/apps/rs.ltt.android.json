Makes heavy use of Android Jetpack to be more maintainable than some of the other Android e-mail clients.\n\nFeatures, and design considerations:\n\n* Heavily cached, but not fully offline capable. Ltt.rs makes use of JMAP’s great caching capabilities. However, marking a thread as read does a round-trip to the server to update things such as read count. The action itself won’t get lost even if performed offline.\n* Account setup and done. Settings invite feature creep and its friend unmaintainability. There is one specific work flow. K-9 Mail or FairEmail is more suitable for others.\n* Minimal dependencies. Only widely known, highly tested libraries from reputable vendors. Third-party libraries are often of poor quality, and end up unmaintained.\n* First class Autocrypt. Ltt.rs fits right into its strict UX guidelines.\n* Based on jmap-mua, a headless e-mail client, or a library that handles everything an e-mail client would, aside from data storage and UI. There is also lttrs-cli, which uses the same library.\n* Looks to Gmail for inspiration in cases of uncertainty.\n","repo":{"author":"Daniel Gultsch","repo":"https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/lttrs-android"},"version":"6dfff21ddcc5d2b541728ef0df68d564350c7c0d06f42a709158a2186069810b","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/lttrs-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
