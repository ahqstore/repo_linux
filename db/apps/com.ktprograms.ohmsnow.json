Once you have set all the bands to match your resistor's colours, you can then read its value in the text field below.\n\nBy long pressing on a band, a popup menu shows up to let you choose the band's color.\n\nYou can swipe left/right to go to the previous/next E series value.\n\nWhen in 5 band mode, tapping the '6' icon in the top right will enter into 6 band mode. Tapping the icon (which will have changed to a '5' icon) again will go back to 5 band mode.\n\nThere is now ceramic capacitor decoding with all the same features (long press for list, swipe for values) as with resistors.","repo":{"author":"ktprograms","repo":"https://codeberg.org/ktprograms/Ohms_Now"},"version":"bf036f13a5c4456aa0903728dbbedfb3f7c43defe9c861350881c9b9357b5561","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/ktprograms/Ohms_Now","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
