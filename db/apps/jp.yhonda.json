Maxima, and its predecessor Macsyma is one of the most long-established\nsoftware in the world, back in 1960s at MIT LCS and Project Mac. You can perform\nmany many math operations such as integration, differentiation, matrix\noperations, rational numbers, symbolic treatment of constants such as pi, e,\neuler's gamma, symbolic and numerical treatment of special functions such as\nsin(x), cos(x), log(x), exp(x), zeta(s), and many more.\n\nMaxima on Android is a port of Maxima on the Android operating system. Thanks to\nSylvain Ageneau' effort on porting Embeddable Common Lisp to the Android OS, the\nlatest Maxima code runs nicely on ECL on Android with very small changes to the\nsource code.\n\nThe installation of the software requires total of 90MB on the storage. 30MB\nneeds to be installed on the internal storage. The rest of 60MB can be installed\neither on the external or the internal storage. The first run of the apk will\nask you where you want the 60MB to be installed.","repo":{"author":"Yasuaki Honda","repo":"https://github.com/YasuakiHonda/Maxima-on-Android-AS"},"version":"3c64dcc138b24092ab4814a3a3c02bdb453cbf17f526951a3f3d490b9bbe091f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/YasuakiHonda/Maxima-on-Android-AS","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
