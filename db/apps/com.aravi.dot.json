Configuring the App is as simple as enabling the Safe Dots Accessibility Service (Toggle switch in the App › (More) Downloaded Services/Installed Services › Dot › Enable).\n\nBy default, the App is configured to show iOS 14 style colored access dots - green for camera access, orange for microphone access. The App itself does not request for the camera or microphone access so, don't worry!.\n\nThe app displays <i>Safe Dots</i> whenever the phone's camera or microphone is engaged by a third-party App.\n\nMaintain an Access Log, which can be accessed from the App's main settings screen. The Access Log shows when the camera/microphone was accessed, which App was in the foreground at the time of access initiation and how long did the access last.\n","repo":{"author":"Aravind Chowdary","repo":"https://github.com/kamaravichow/safe-dot-android"},"version":"a4885ce81b2b866007339bab61ac493f01556a5d6c9bbe41ca93d37bfb6b5b13","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/kamaravichow/safe-dot-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
