All available system sensors and some custom defined sources are used to record and export data for further analysis.\n\nThe interval and sensors to be used can be individually defined and thus enables a highly customizable data collection application. Sensorkraken only aims at collecting data and not analyzing/visualizing.\n\nFor more information see the webpage at https://sensorkraken.org\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/sensorkraken/android-app"},"version":"ac5ac5f91c42f62207f2e80194596f712027f08d3a11c3ea30ed83f9867a1937","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/sensorkraken/android-app","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
