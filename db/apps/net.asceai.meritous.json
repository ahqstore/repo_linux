A place of limitless power.  Those that seek to control such a utopia will soon bring an end to themselves.  Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him, PSI user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus Dome in search of answers.\nMeritous is a action-adventure game with simple controls but a challenge to find a balance of power verses recovery time during real-time battles. Set in a fractually-generated world, the player can explore thousands of rooms in search of powerful artifacts, tools to help them, and to eventually free the Orcus Dome from evil.  .","repo":{"author":"Sylvain Beucler","repo":"https://gitlab.com/meritous/sdl_android"},"version":"faecb224f41eaa29f194ff2fb0f17c2d2029f0d594ad36d7936493439fc60a21","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/meritous/sdl_android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
