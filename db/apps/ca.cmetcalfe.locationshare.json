This includes (but isn't limited to) sharing via SMS, email, social\nnetworks, note taking applications, etc.\n\nSimply launch the application and wait until the device homes in on your\nlocation. You'll then have the option to view the location on a map, share it,\nor copy it to the clipboard.","repo":{"author":"pR0Ps","repo":"https://github.com/pR0Ps/LocationShare"},"version":"e9bb6243834c981daa1f0385376abf67058e1b6a7561c4cc066500dd6f7a9668","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/pR0Ps/LocationShare","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
