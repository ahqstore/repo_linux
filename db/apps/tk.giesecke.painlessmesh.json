The app can connect, request routing info (NODE_SYNC_REQUEST)\nand send single (SINGLE) and broadcast (BROADCAST) messages. There is no\nsupport for (TIME_DELAY), (TIME_SYNC) and (NODE_SYNC_REPLY). The app is\nconnecting to the closest painlessMesh AP.\n\nDue to restrictions of Android, painlessMesh can not have AP and STA mode\nrunning in parallel. Since Android 6 it requires the location service\npermission from the user to be able to scan for Wi-Fi networks.","repo":{"author":"Bernd Giesecke","repo":"https://gitlab.com/beegee1962/painlessmesh_android"},"version":"d24c28b7d5b8ce9757b25c102a5affd3e63c475cba1fa1f1914a8b96bb9d7a96","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/beegee1962/painlessmesh_android","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
