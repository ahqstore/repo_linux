The starting point is the measured radioactive\ncontamination of the air, as measured  when it reaches the affected area first.\nFrom this, the radiation exposure from  direct radiation, soil radiation and\nfood intake is estimated. Then the risks are  analyzed and behavioral measures\nare derived.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Tschernobyl"},"version":"274d8cc9fbf64df6012f168a905c5752d1554db171f67b6b7bfb4e9b254b7945","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Tschernobyl","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
