All Stetho functions are given besides Network Monitoring. For this\nhowever I highly recommend using mitmproxy or tcpdump and Wireshark.\n\nThis Module can be used for Reverse Engineering. Especially the Layout Preview\nis very useful. Please also take a look at Inspackage since this will add even\nmore functions for this purpose.\n\nATTENTION:Never leave this Module enabled or installed on day to day use. THIS\nIS A SECURITY RISK. Only enable this for Development.","repo":{"author":"Christian Schabesberger","repo":"https://gitlab.com/derSchabi/Stethox"},"version":"6845b2a89d36227464c155d12ffb0d5b26981c8a1ffe3fe5a3210f5a2a9e432e","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/derSchabi/Stethox","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
