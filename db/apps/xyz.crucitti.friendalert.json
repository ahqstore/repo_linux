While\nthese connections add immeasurable value to our lives, keeping them vibrant across distances can be\na challenge. Born from this universal struggle, FriendAlert is your go-to solution for keeping those\nimportant friendships alive and well.</p>\n<h1>Functions</h1>\n<p>The application offers a simple reminder to remember to contact your friends: you can set how often you\nwant to keep in touch and every time you call a friend you can record that inside the app. If you\ndo not call one of your friends for a time longer than the limit you set, you'll be sent a notification.</p>\n<p>üåç <strong>Your Central Hub for Global Friendships</strong>\nWhether your friendships were formed on the playground or during an international journey,\nFriendAlert functions as your unified platform for sustaining these invaluable bonds. With\nFriendAlert, neither miles nor time zones can weaken your connections.</p>\n<p>üó£Ô∏è <strong>Foster Authentic Connections: More than Just Check-ins</strong>\nSocial media may offer cursory updates about people&#39;s lives, but it&#39;s no substitute for genuine\nconversation. FriendAlert encourages you to engage in meaningful dialogues that go beyond the\nsuperficial.</p>\n<h1 id=\"a-personal-perspective\">A Personal Perspective</h1>\n<p>I created FriendAlert with the aim of maintaining contact with the people who matter most to me.\nWhile the app&#39;s utility can vary, here are some personal guidelines I follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use FriendAlert to track those you find you&#39;re losing touch with, not the friends you see\nregularly.</li>\n<li>Although in-person meetings are irreplaceable, phone or video calls serve as excellent\nalternatives when that&#39;s not feasible.</li>\n<li>Texting, though convenient, falls short in conveying emotional nuance and should not be your\nprimary mode of communication.</li>\n<li>Engaging via social media‚Äîsuch as liking photos or commenting‚Äîsimply doesn‚Äôt cut it when it comes\nto nurturing real friendships.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"elevate-your-social-ecosystem\">Elevate Your Social Ecosystem</h1>\n<p>FriendAlert emerged from a personal need for an accessible, budget-friendly way to sustain my social\ncircle. While platforms like nouri.ai have their merits, FriendAlert offers a free and user-friendly\nalternative.</p>\n<p>Sharing good moments is nice. Let&#39;s enrich not just our conversations, but our lives and communities\nthrough stronger, more meaningful connections.</p>","repo":{"author":"Davidoskky","repo":"https://gitlab.com/audreanne/friend-alert"},"version":"4dd2a2bb690874d258ca3777722c52b331de8c5605158a4bac1024e8dfff9a43","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/audreanne/friend-alert","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
