It\ncontains info on how to make fire, build a shelter, find food, heal and other\nuseful content in a case of emergency.\n\nBut it does not have to be used in emergency situations only - it can be also\nuseful for trips to the outdoors, hiking, camping, learning about nature and\nyourself truly. This is not only fun, but you can also train skills (make fire,\nbuild shelter, ..) you might need in a catastrophy. Some things work best with\npractice in a relaxed environment - then you also have time for some\nexperiments.","repo":{"author":"ligi","repo":"https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual"},"version":"6dbc943ce56b34a531fb7e0d6b668f980544389db40da0de7ca440f9f0ba3174","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
