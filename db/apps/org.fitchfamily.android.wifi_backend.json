One part passively\nmonitors the GPS. If the GPS has acquired and has a good position accuracy, then\nthe WiFi APs detected by the phone are stored.\n\nThe other part is the actual location provider which uses the database to\nestimate location when the GPS is not available or has not yet gotten its first\nfix. The use of stored WiFi AP can dramatically decrease the GPS time to first\nfix.\n\nThis backend performs no network data. All data acquired by the phone stays on\nthe phone and no queries are made to a centralized AP location provider.","repo":{"author":"n76","repo":"https://github.com/n76/wifi_backend"},"version":"90c01ad628b454d612871da90c92f013aaa9868a4e220c5547529dc69831e176","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/n76/wifi_backend","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
