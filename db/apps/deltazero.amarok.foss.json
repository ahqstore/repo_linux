These encryptors, while effective, tend to be slow and resource-intensive, making the encryption of large files such as videos and music a daunting task. Despite their robust security, these methods are often overkill for the average user who simply wish to keep their private files and apps out of unintentional reach.</p><p> Amarok is designed to be a light-weight hider. It disguises file names and headers, causing them to seem \"corrupted\" and unopenable. Amarok also deactivates applications, rendering them invisible in the launcher and system menu.</p><p><b>Features</b></p><ul> <li><strong>User-Friendly</strong>: Easily hide files and applications with a single click.</li> <li><strong>Rapid and Efficient Large File Hiding</strong>: Hides by altering only file name and signature, unaffected by file size.</li> <li><strong>Root-Free Application Hiding</strong>: Makes apps vanish from the launcher. Compatible with Root, Shizuku, Dhizuku, and DSM modes.</li> <li><strong>Panic button</strong>: Use a floating button to quickly hide applications and files in urgent scenarios. </li> <li><strong>Quick Settings Tile</strong>: A control center toggle for immediate hiding, bypassing the need to launch the app.</li> <li><strong>App Lock</strong>: Secure Amarok access with a password or fingerprint.</li> <li><strong>Pleasant Interface</strong>: Clean Material3 design.</li></ul><p>Please be aware that Amarok is <b>not an encryption software</b>, but rather a tool for hiding things. <b>We strongly advise against using Amarok to protect confidential files and applications.</b></p>","repo":{"author":"deltazefiro","repo":"https://github.com/deltazefiro/Amarok-Hider"},"version":"468ec64e06ffc94c28f86eae4dc0ea18422d320c7a3dfd50c24b10f082548d88","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/deltazefiro/Amarok-Hider","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
