If the app finds out that a tracker is following you, you will receive a notification.\n\nThese trackers are only the size of a coin and are often used to track people. Unfortunately, each tracker works differently, so you often need multiple apps to detect tracking.\nAirGuard combines the detection of different trackers so you only need one app to keep you safe.\n\nOnce a tracker has been found, you can make it ring (doesn't work on all models) or go searching with a manual scan.\nIf you find a tracker, we advise you to deactivate it so that it no longer tracks your location.\n\nThe app only saves your location locally to show you later where a tracker has followed you. This app never shares personal data.\n\nIf the app does not find any trackers, then the app will not bother you.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Niklas Bittner","repo":"https://github.com/seemoo-lab/AirGuard"},"version":"a516470af0ce9f3459f85924e9f2d009b143b84d0b99b780b841c2214000ce70","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/seemoo-lab/AirGuard","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
