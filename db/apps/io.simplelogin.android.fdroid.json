It allows you to create quickly a random email address (aka alias). All emails sent to an alias are forwarded to your personal email address. You can use the alias when subscribing to a newsletter, signing up for a new account, giving your email to someone you don't trust. Not only an alias can receive emails, it can also send emails. An alias is a full-fledged email address. Later you can simply block or delete an alias if it's too spammy.</p>\n\n<b>Why SimpleLogin?</b>\nWhen you give away your personal email online, there is a good chance that your email address would end up with a spammer or a hacker. SimpleLogin acts as a firewall to protect your personal email inbox.\n\n<b>What distinguishes SimpleLogin:</b>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open-source and easy to self-host.
