Galnet is part of the Multilingual Central Repository (http://adimen.si.ehu.es/web/MCR) and the Open Multilingual Wordnet (http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/iliomw/omw). Galnet contents can be searched with several web applications and can also be downloaded in RDF and LMF formats with a free license (http://sli.uvigo.gal/download/SLI_Galnet/).\n\nInformation and contact: Xavier Gómez Guinovart (xgg2021@gmail.com)\n","repo":{"author":"Xavier Gómez Guinovart","repo":"https://github.com/xavier-gz/digalnet"},"version":"3fcbf631157307b006e19cff846ba638a8047555d1ae4a597c146d070336a55d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/xavier-gz/digalnet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
