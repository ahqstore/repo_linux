It is another\ntake on a 'Mindfulness Bell', with the addition of accompanying text\nto provide added context to the mindfulness reminder.\n\nThe reminders are taken from a configurable list, and are chosen\nat random at each interval. The reminder interval can either\nbe periodic (in intervals aligned to the top of the hour, down \nto a 15 minute granularity) or random (between a selected range \nof minutes).\n\nSome default reminders are provided as examples. You can add,\nedit, or remove these default reminders as you like.\n\nThere are 5 different bells included, and you can also configure\nyour own custom bell from your phone's local storage.\n\nThis app works very well in conjunction with a smartwatch. In\nthis mode you can also mute the bell to have silent mindfulness\nprompts throughout your day.\n\nThis app uses the following permissions:\n\n- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Required by the library used to launch the github source code site\n- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: Required by the underlying alarm service to restart after reboot\n- WAKE_LOCK: Required by the underlying alarm service to wake up at the scheduled time\n- USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT: Required to show app in foreground from the reminder notification\n- VIBRATE: Required to vibrate during notifications\n- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Required for backup.
