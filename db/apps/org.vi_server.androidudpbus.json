To aid building VPNs, video streaming and other tricky network uses.\n\n<br><b>Features:</b>\n\n* Binding UDP socket on specified port and exchanging traffic between all known peers\n* Exchanging traffic between multiple UDP sockets\n* Remembering specified number of peers that have sent us some datagram, with optional expiration policy\n* Directly specifying peers to send datagrams to. Combined with remembering, it allows using the application as UDP forwarder.\n* Joining multicast groups, setting TTL, TOS, read and write buffer sizes and other socket options.\n* Periodical sending of hardcoded datagrams to specified peers (e.g. to keep NAT open)\n* Displaying of detailed statistics of the traffic\n* Starting multiple isolated hubs, each with distinct set of ports. Can even act as a simplistic load balancer due to <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>.\n\nThe application does not send datagrams back to sender.\n\n<br><b>Limitations:</b>\n\n* UI is not user-friendly.\n* Not all features are exposed in GUI - you may want to add some undocumented fields to the JSON manually.\n* Not very optimised for speed or latency. It may be slightly slower than socat udp4-l udp.\n* Not everything is tested yet\n* Documentation is lacking\n\n","repo":{"author":"Vitaly Shukela","repo":"https://github.com/vi/android-udp-bus"},"version":"e6085f344fcd764625a9f4491c0aa6803256d754feb3bf1d0797ad2169cfc87f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/vi/android-udp-bus","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
