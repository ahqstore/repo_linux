It only parses the website in order to gain the information it needs. Therefore this app can be used on devices without Google Services installed. Also, you don't need a YouTube account to use NewPipe, and it's FLOSS.\n","repo":{"author":"Team NewPipe","repo":"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe"},"version":"48cc64f5b0dcccca55ac36c039c88476cd826188366ee838786eec05e5379a96","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
