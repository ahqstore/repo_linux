The number of tiles is automatically chosen based on the number of configured cameras: a single camera goes full screen, adding more cameras the app switches to a grid view: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and so on.\nThe maximum number of cameras is determined by the device's capabilities.\n\nThe stream decoding and rendering is demanded to VLC's library: without their effort this app wouldn't be possible.\nThis app was specifically developed for F-Droid, as I couldn't find any open source RTSP viewers in the main repository.\n\nThe app can be opened deeplinking to url ojo://view\nTo open the app with focus on a specific camera, you can use an intent (it.danieleverducci.ojo.OPEN_CAMERA) to specify which camera you want to view.\nThe extra argument it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NAME will open the app with the camera with the name you specified while adding the camera.\nThe extra argument it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NUMBER starting at 1 could be used as well, if you have multiple cameras with the same name.\n\nSee below an example how to use the intent. The flag (-f 268468224) could be useful if you want to switch to another camera while the app is running:\n\n    adb -s <YOUR_DEVICE> shell am start -a it.danieleverducci.ojo.OPEN_CAMERA -f 268468224 --es it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NAME <YOUR_CAMERA_NAME>\n    adb -s <YOUR_DEVICE> shell am start -a it.danieleverducci.ojo.OPEN_CAMERA -f 268468224 --es it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NUMBER <YOUR_CAMERA_NUMBER>\n","repo":{"author":"Daniele Verducci","repo":"https://github.com/penguin86/ojo"},"version":"ec4c2c62059a78e2bfcd8e6fe565c02b6f277d1b6c256af6ecb03a4549b3ec0a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/penguin86/ojo","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
