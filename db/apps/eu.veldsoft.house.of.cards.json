There are also four\nHouses each “coloured” by one of the four suits. You put one by one\nthe random cards, that the dealer randomly deals from the deck, to one\nof the different Houses (it is of no importance the cards to be of the\nsame suit with the House), trying to achieve a total of 31 in the house.\nThe total is calculated adding the cards (Ace counts for 11, Kings,\nQueens, Jacks for 10 and the rest as they are, i.e. the 8 of Spades\ncounts for 8). Every time you manage to achieve a 31 in one of the\nhouses you get a bonus regarding the House in which you achieved that\n(10 for Spades, 20 for Clubs, 30 for Diamonds, 40 for Hearts) and the\nHouse becomes empty (total = 0). If in one of the Houses the total will\nexceed 31 then this House is closed and you cannot use it any more adding\ncards to it. In order to win you should add all 52 cards in the Houses\nand only then your score counts in the hall of fame. You lose if all the\nfour Houses will be closed.\n\nIf the number of cards in a House will be six (6) and the total is less\nthan 31, it counts as a 31, the player gets 50 points and the House\nbecomes empty.\n\nThis rule adds 4 Jokers to the deck (each with a different suit). If\nyou add it to the House “coloured” with the same suit (e.g. the Heart\nspecial card to the Heart House) then it is like having 31 no matter\nwhat was the total there and the player gets 100 points, but if you\nadd it to a House “coloured” with another suit (e.g. the Heart card\nto the Diamond House) you lose immediately.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/HouseOfCards"},"version":"233a7dec588c473c316ac27ed194b745b75b9b49a4e23438a247cfff25fc24e9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/HouseOfCards","license_or_tos":"LGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
