With offline maps, there is no necessity for a mobile data plan.\n\nThe default map is provided by <a href=\"https://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap.org</a>.\nJoin the community and help to improve the map, see <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap\">www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap</a>\n\nPlease consider downloading an offline map to decrease the server load and save your mobile data plan.\nSome offline maps can be found here:\n- <a href=\"http://download.mapsforge.org/\">Mapsforge</a>\n- <a href=\"https://www.freizeitkarte-osm.de/android/en/\">Freizeitkarte Android</a>\n- <a href=\"https://www.openandromaps.org/en\">OpenAndroMaps</a>\n\nSome maps require special themes to render correctly! These need to be downloaded and configured accordingly.\n\nOffline maps can be downloaded via the menu \"Map download\" or by visiting the above mentioned websites and click the download links. Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) require a long click on the link and \"Open link in external app\" and then choose OSMDashboard.\n\nManual downloaded offline maps or maps shared with other apps can be opened from your Android device. Select the directory in the menu \"Map directory\".","repo":{"author":"OpenTracks Team","repo":"https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OSMDashboard"},"version":"0ab2bae787f68e1b99d05566e00ebab4a8dbefc0a6c12b464d02afbb262cf7cd","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OSMDashboard","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
