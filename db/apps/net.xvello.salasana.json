If one of\nthem is hacked or malevolent, you risk exposing your other accounts.\n\nIt mixes together your personal master password and the website domain using\na little cryptographic magic we call SHA-1. It will always get the same result\nif given that domain name and master password, but will never get that result\nif either changes. (Well, once in a few billion times it might.)\n","repo":{"author":"Xavier Vello","repo":"https://github.com/xvello/salasana-android"},"version":"5d18f53c29b6e4fd5471c54681d52b62fca1cfc687a081e04ac005bafeb56eec","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/xvello/salasana-android","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
