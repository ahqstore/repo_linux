This is an RPN-based calculator that works in floating point,\nand integers expressed in hex, decimal, octal or binary.  I modified Emmet's \nWRPN (with permission) so that it uses rendered fonts for the keys. This \nmakes them look nice and crisp on high resolution displays.\n\nI offer this software as-is, with no guarantee of any kind. The source is \navailable on github. There's also a desktop Java version -- see \nhttps://jrpn.jovial.com/ for both.\n","repo":{"author":"Bill Foote","repo":"https://github.com/zathras/JRPN_Android"},"version":"929a8fb1d0dc51979cab73e13708cb64d8a0b67c6176ed51c9452d294418ce54","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/zathras/JRPN_Android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
