With configurable quick access to apps, shortcuts, or contacts via a list or by gestures.\n\nSupports app shortcuts, both static and dynamic.\n\nSearch function optionally integrates the contact list, and includes a configurable web search.\n\nTries to have enough configurability without making testing corner cases tedious, to ensure functionality and robustness.\n\nWeather info (uses network and location services, if necessary).\n\nNew app developed from scratch. Takes inspiration from Unlauncher (a fork of Slimlauncher), and Nolauncher, and also feedback of users.\n\nFeatures:\n\n  - uniform and elegant text-based design\n  - configurable quick access and gestures on home screen\n  - shortcut support (long click on app by default)\n  - hide/show apps (but keep searchable)\n  - apps can be renamed and reordered\n  - good search function for apps\n  - integrated contact list search\n  - integrated, configurable web search\n  - clock options\n  - date format options\n  - weather forecast options (via open-meteo.com)\n  - configurable colour scheme\n  - can use system wallpaper as background\n  - free open source software\n  - no icon set support (no need: no icons at all)\n  - no widget support\n\n","repo":{"author":"Henrik Theiling","repo":"https://github.com/moehriegitt/NeatLauncher"},"version":"80b1b5bc61afa7d07b9c956d7e590d8df5b039543b3513e1f6b66fb35573d397","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/moehriegitt/NeatLauncher","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
