You can download host files to block a set of known advertising or malicious host names and then create exemptions where you see fit.\n\nIt works by creating a lightweight VPN service that filters your internet traffic as you use your device. If you ever have trouble with connecting to a site or using an app, you can always exempt an app from filtering or create an exception for a specific host name.\n","repo":{"author":"Charles Lombardo","repo":"https://github.com/t895/DNSNet"},"version":"d3013d725472652f9ecc5e1a5c3a6482d07332525bf948e856ba766106dc553c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/t895/DNSNet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
