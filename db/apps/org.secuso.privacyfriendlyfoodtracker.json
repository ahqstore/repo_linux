The app also allows\nan analysis of calorie consumption over a larger timeframe such as weeks\nor months.\n\nWhat functionality does this app include?\n- Personalization through the creation of your own products\n- Calculation of the total calorie count for the day\n- Creation of statistics and graphs that show total and average calorie intake over a week or a month\n- Calendar overview to quickly show daily overviews\n- Encryption of data on the device\n- Online search to find products quickly and easily\n\nThis app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed\nby the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. You can find more information at https://secuso.org/pfa.\n\nThis food tracker does not collect any information about its users. The database\nis encrypted to guarantee absolute privacy. Also this app does not require any dangerous permissions from the user. Only internet access is needed for\nthe search function. Additionally, this food tracker does not include any\ntracking or any advertisements at all. This increases battery lifetime and reduces or eliminates data usage by this app.\n\nPlease note that the online search requests information from the OpenFoodFacts\ndatabase. This would theoretically allow the database to track a users nutritional\nhabits. For absolute privacy it is therefore recommended to not use the online\nsearch feature (The request is not triggered until the 'search' button is pressed).\nThe app also works without an internet connection.\n\nYou can reach us via\nTwitter - @SECUSOResearch https://twitter.com/secusoresearch\nMastodon - @SECUSO_Research@baw√º.social https://xn--baw-joa.social/@SECUSO_Research/\nJob opening - https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/english/Job_Offers_1557.php","repo":{"author":"SECUSO - Security Usability Society","repo":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-food-tracker"},"version":"d5383f0d313779b19966aa64bf14ebb440da0991be9c78aef055dd6ef8c8bd03","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-food-tracker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
