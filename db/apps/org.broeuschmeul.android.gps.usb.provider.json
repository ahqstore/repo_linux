I have a main controller which automatically starts this application's background service when my car starts.</p>\n<p>The application is designed to work with any SiRF USB GPS device, however it has been tested as working with GlobalSat BU-353-S4 and a device based on the UBLOX LEA-M8P chip.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/freshollie/UsbGps4Droid"},"version":"788c0d70799235c79fe575b766a88c724eb531d68a65c0d1562ee22cff3f6059","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/freshollie/UsbGps4Droid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
