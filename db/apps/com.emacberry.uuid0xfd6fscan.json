If in your country a warn-app is in place that makes use of the Framework you can see how many devices around you have the potential to exchange randomised & anonymous contact tracing information that can help to follow possible infection chains.\n\nPlease note that this app does not make use of the ExposureNotification Framework itself - nor it creates any BluetoothLE Beacon - the app also does not store any information about you or other devices that will be detected.\n","repo":{"author":"marq24","repo":"https://github.com/marq24/UUID0xFD6FTracer"},"version":"1319afd0c97d5da0c4542a840fc924aa61537d0b5de2f3a5b2fe6ae6c00aab53","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/marq24/UUID0xFD6FTracer","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
