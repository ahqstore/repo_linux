You can set your paste to expire 💣 after a set duration.\nOr burn on read 🔥 (Mission Impossible style!), to prevent unintended persons from accessing it later.\n\nIf you know of PrivateBin, this is the first and only mobile client for it that we know of :)\nPrivateBin: https://privatebin.info/\n\n\nEnjoy sharing your pastes privately!\n\n\nBuilt with love 🫶, Kotlin 🏝️  and Rust 🦀.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo"},"version":"066ee0406d8ee9daaea521290777fc4dcfa42845eed8bbfcdb7feaffdaabe965","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/nain-F49FF806/sharepaste.oo","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
