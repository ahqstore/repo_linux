A moment later, the share 'dialog' will reappear. Now just share with the app you intended to share with in the first place.\n\nEt voilà!\n\n<b>Required Android Permissions:</b>\n\n★ READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to read the images other apps share with it.\n\n<b>Source Code</b>\n\n★ This app is open source. You can take a look at the code (and contribute if you feel like it) here:\n\nhttps://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif\n\n<b>Translations</b>\n\nIf you wish to help to translate this app to your own language, you can do so by translating these two projects using transifex:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/ and https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/libcommon/.\n\n<b>Misc Stuff and Facts</b>\n\n★ Basically, Exif is used by jpeg, which is the format in which your Android camera saves pictures. If you want to know more about Exif, check the Wikipedia.\n\n★ Scrambled Exif also renames the files (this can be disabled).\n\n★ Please don't heavily rely on the data being deleted. Scrambled Exif does its job pretty well, but it could fail. Always double-check before you share.\n\n★ It doesn't really <i>scramble</i> the Exif data, it deletes it. So the name is probably stupid. But I like it. The icon doesn't depict scrambled eggs either. So the icon is probably stupid. But I like it. And I also happen to be a huge fan of eggs. So this app doesn't only have a stupid name and an equally stupid icon, it is also my (non-stupid) tribute to eggs. Especially <i>huevos fritos</i>. Because I love them.\n\n★ Have fun sharing your pics!","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/tree/HEAD"},"version":"ad90f511e786fdb674b2f6630f873251ca2d9bf9d06c6aea4aa8220d7ce927d3","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
