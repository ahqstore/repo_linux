The user can clear the files manually or schedule the app to automatically remove the redundant files daily/weekly.\n\n- Currently the app only scans for backup files in 'WhatsApp' and 'WhatsApp Business' folders.\n- The main backup file with the name 'msgstore.db.cryptXX' is not deleted and is always kept so that the user can still recover their data should they uninstall WhatsApp at some point.\n","repo":{"author":"Thabang Serumula","repo":"https://github.com/tserumula/DbCleanerforWhatsapp"},"version":"9e14569f3e4521a0aee0ae816b1ee15d7ca39d6ab1a7d426b04f27906e38ad4f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tserumula/DbCleanerforWhatsapp","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
