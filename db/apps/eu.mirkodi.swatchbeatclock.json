Could you use some change in your life?\n\nLet me introduce you to the <b>Swatch Internet Time</b> format!\n\nInstead of dividing the day into 24 hours, it divides it into 1000 .beat's. 6:00 AM becomes \"@250\", 11:27 PM becomes \"@977\" and so on! In addition to that, there are no timezones in Internet Time. It's the same all over the world. It's based on Biel Mean Time (BMT), similar to Central European Time (CET).\n\nOf course, getting used to this new format might not be easy, and even when you learn it, you will still need a .beat clock.\n\nThat's where the Swatch .beat clock app comes into place. With a handy converter and a fully functional digital clock, it will help you through your journey.\n\nRead more about Internet Time on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time\">Wikipedia</a>.\n","repo":{"author":"mirk0dex","repo":"https://codeberg.org/mirk0dex/swatchbeatclock"},"version":"677398dfe9ee171fed39e011dd182c42913f442364d9695b1a2f3f402597b478","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/mirk0dex/swatchbeatclock","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
