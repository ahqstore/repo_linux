(Please <a href=\"https://github.com/rubenpgrady/dpcopycat/issues/new\">let me know</a> if you are aware of another workaround.)<br />\nThat is, of course, assuming you don't have access to root privileges. However, you might not desire to root your phone, either because it can turn out to be quite difficult to achieve, or because it has numerous disadvantages in itself, anyway.<br />\nAnother option is to connect to the phone via <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tools/adb\">Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</a> and run:<br />\n<blockquote><tt>adb shell dumpsys | sed -n '/^Packages:/,/^[[:space:]]*$/p'</tt></blockquote>\nThe command prints the \"Packages\" section from <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tools/dumpsys\"><tt>dumpsys</tt></a>, which contains detailed information about every installed package. It works, but the downside is obvious: You need an extra device to connect and run <tt>adb</tt>.<br />\nThis app strives to reproduce the output from above command, right on your phone - neither root privileges nor ADB required - using only API calls and the <tt>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</tt> permission.<br />\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/rubenpgrady/dpcopycat"},"version":"141c13c51cd4f957adc3ad27891e02c0fa91c3d8e1421ae11b07057b9d8b87c4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/rubenpgrady/dpcopycat","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
