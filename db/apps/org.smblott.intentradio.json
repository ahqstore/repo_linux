It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast\nintents. If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is probably\nnot the app for you.\n\nIntent Radio was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and events\ntriggered from other apps.\n\nDespite its name, Intent Radio will happily play any audio media supported\nnatively by Android, including local content.\n\n<b>Important:</b> You must run the app manually at least once before Android will\ndeliver broadcast intents. This is an Android security feature. Thereafter, even\nafter reboots, it should not be necessary to run the app at all.","repo":{"author":"Stephen Blott","repo":"https://github.com/smblott-github/intent_radio"},"version":"dd0bd7fe3146917e8bc69815bb51635b5bd43e49a91754739cb3e398f7d503f7","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/smblott-github/intent_radio","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
