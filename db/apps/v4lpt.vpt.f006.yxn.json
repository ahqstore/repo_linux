If you want to minimize the time you would normally lose in option paralysis, just press the big red button. The answer is a decisive and strict YES XOR NO. And there is also a delay to hinder you from fooling yourself and coming back to biased circles of fruitless thinking. But this is just what I think. Let me know what you think in the comments. ;) \n<strong>Everything is calculated locally, nothing is saved. Your data are yours. Nobody will ever learn about your specific love for wearing mismatched socks.</strong>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work</h2>\nAsk yourself a Yes/No question in your head\nYou click the big red button\nYour answer will appear on the screen\nTo prevent cheating, you can't go back for 5s. \n\nCreated with ❤️ by Valentin\n","repo":{"author":"Valentin","repo":"https://github.com/v4lpt/YXN"},"version":"1e7ed9752cd708b0242df61f6fa1f464957c13d9c5117b5318b3be2bee36f88d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/v4lpt/YXN","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
