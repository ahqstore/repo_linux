This is just started by me, a student at the TU Darmstadt, that has to much spare time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe Moodle at the TU Darmstadt regularly sends me mails with Moodle links to courses, forum posts and other content on Moodle. I always read those\nmails on my android phone, but clicking on those links from the mails results in opening the browser. I installed the official Moodle App, and wanted the links to open in the Moodle App.\nAs this is not nativly supported by the Moodle App, I sat down and coded this little app, that redirects links to the Moodle App.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter the app was finished, I wondered, if someone else could find this useful. The app is minimal and easy to use. Just install it, and all\nsupported links can be opened in Moodle.\n</p>\n\n<h6>Prerequisites</h6>\n<p>\nYou will need to have and android phone with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow and the official Moodle App with at least version 2 installed.\n</p>\n\n<h6>Which moodle links are supported?</h6>\nThis app supports the folloing Moodle URLs (https only):\n<ul>\n    <li>moodle.tu-darmstadt.de (standard Moodle)</li>\n    <li>moodle.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de (computer science Moodle)</li>\n    <li>vorkurs.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodlevorkurs (Moodle for the mathematicans preliminary course)</li>\n    <li>wwwdid.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodle (some other probably outdated Moodle installation I found)</li>\n    <li>moodle-exam.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle installation for online exams)</li>\n    <li>moodle.chor.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle of the TU choir)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nIf the TU Darmstadt has any other Moodle URLs I should include, open an issue and let me know.\n</p>\n\n<h6>How to uninstall the app?</h6>\n<p>\nThe app won't show up on your home screen. This is intended, as there is no need for a home screen icon.\nTo uninstall the app, open your System Settings -> Apps -> search for \"TU Darmstadt Moodle Wrapper\".\n</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Jonas Bernard","repo":"https://github.com/JonasBernard/TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper"},"version":"f138e722c60a94a78e923ca3c2b63d3dbdb9008f8ef55a2dc044cba6e0048487","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/JonasBernard/TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
