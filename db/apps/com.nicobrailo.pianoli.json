Use this app as a\nbaby-game and, more importantly, to prevent random taps of a baby from\ndoing anything you may not want. This app will show a small piano a baby\ncan use to explore sounds in a mobile device. At the same time, it will\nblock any naive attempts at closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu\nbuttons will be blocked, and Android's top menu won't be available. This\nensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any actions on\nthe device you may not want.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PianOli"},"version":"89cebebebb7d8f95d59b206826d12db13a28b417bb0b78a19618ebd770a9f530","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PianOli","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
