Use the backup to move your data from one device to another device.\n★ Safe Notes provides ultimate security - you don't have to trust us, or any other third party because everything is done locally on your phone.\n★ Contrary to the ongoing frenzy of \"move everything to cloud\" we believe in \"localization of user data\" giving you the control of your data and not some third-party cloud service provider.\n★ Completely anonymous, no inbound and outbound requests.\n\n\n--- How it works ---\n\n★ Safe Notes encrypt each note with a unique AES-256 symmetric key derived from your passphrase and randomly generated salt.\n★ If an attacker tries to brute-force your encrypted notes it will take \"Trillions Upon Trillions years\" in contrast, the universe has only existed for 15 billion years. (You must use strong and long passphrase).\n★ AES-256 is symmetric key encryption that is quantum-resistant, i.e. it isn't vulnerable to quantum computers.\n★ Everything is stored locally on the user's device.\n★ Your passphrase is never stored on the device, it gets purged as soon as you exit the app.\n★ We can't decrypt your notes even if we wanted to. That gives you the ultimate security, but it also means that a lost passphrase can never be recovered.\n★ Safe Notes is an open-source, not-for-profit project.","repo":{"author":"Keshav Priyadarshi","repo":"https://github.com/keshav-space/safenotes"},"version":"81ffff3d8bfbcec3fd8e1ab33c282bb20d6769e4bdf172560e30c3304e5f61ad","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/keshav-space/safenotes","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
