If you need\nto use Google Maps install the developer's build from the website.\n\nKeep your eyes on the road, not your phone! Speed of Sound automatically adjusts\nyour music player's volume while you're driving about with your GPS, lowering\nthe volume while driving slowly or at a stoplight, and cranking it up on the\nhighway.\n\nThis is a feature available in some more expensive cars and sound systems.
