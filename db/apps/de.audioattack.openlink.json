No more cumbersome copy and paste. Easy Open Link also allows you to open several links at the same time.\n\n1. Roughly select the URL(s). It does not matter if the selection also contains additional text or white spaces.\n2. Press the \"share\" symbol.\n3. Select \"open link\"\n\nThe app does not add an icon to the launcher since this is not necessary. The complete functionality of the app is accessed via the \"share\" menu.
