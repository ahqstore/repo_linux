Learn more, download the wallet, and join the journey. \n\nPRIVACY BY DEFAULT\n\nPrivacy should not be optional. Veil aims to make full-time privacy the most convenient choice.\n\nINCENTIVIZED PARTICIPATION\n\nBy holding Veil, our users not only contribute to broadly distributed network security, but earn staking rewards â€” anonymously!\n\nFAIR LAUNCH\n\nNo ICO. No premine. Veil's blockchain is secured via Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake in order to combine both security and fair distribution.\n\nUSER-FOCUSED\n\nIn a digital cash society, participation extends to everybody, not just those who read user manuals. Veil aims to be one of the most user-friendly wallets in crypto.\n\nSELF-SUSTAINING\n\nThe Veil network includes built-in self-funding for project development, operations, customer support, and ongoing research and development.\n\nFUTURE-SAFE\n\nVeil will continue to push the limits of cryptography and blockchain technology through Veil Labs, an entity dedicated to R&D and partnerships with leading academic institutions.\n\n\nProject website:\nhttps://veil-project.com\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/steel97/veil_wallet\nDiscord\nhttps://discord.veil-project.com","repo":{"author":"Ivan Yv","repo":"https://github.com/steel97/veil_wallet"},"version":"0eea65d472f0567b5750433cc9038d9c26fae4cce1f2e2f5149be768479000ae","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/steel97/veil_wallet","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
