Well there is a catch or two. Your library needs to use the\nEvergreen ILS system for their catalog. The other catch is that at this time\nEvergreen Wishlist can only lookup the first (or most recent) fifteen books\nadded to your list.\n\nThe 15 book limit is due to how Amazon's site works, and that may change in the\nfuture. Software usually gets better over time right?","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/asommer70/evergreen-wishlist"},"version":"820efbce410418908e35572d91b305505c75adeb5557296d4441893f68f2c34f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/asommer70/evergreen-wishlist","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
