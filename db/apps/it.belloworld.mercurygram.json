All of your messages and conversations are stored in Telegram's cloud.\n\nThe messaging platform is aimed at mobile devices, but desktop and web clients exist as well.\n\nSeveral proprietary parts were removed from the original Telegram client, including Google Play Services for the location services, HockeySDK for self-updates and push notifications through Google Cloud Messaging. Location sharing functionality is restored using OpenStreetMap.\n\nAnti-Feature: Non-Free Network, since the servers run proprietary software.\n\nThe official source code of the app contains binary blobs, so this tracks a fork which builds those from source. Hence, versions might become available with a certain lag.\n","repo":{"author":"Timothy Redaelli","repo":"https://github.com/Mercurygram/Mercurygram"},"version":"948403f1589eff2336416218744e16f458588e90e94fbb06181bb5a2902ee8d5","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Mercurygram/Mercurygram","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
