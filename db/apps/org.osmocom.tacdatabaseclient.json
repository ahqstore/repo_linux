While other\ndatabases exist, they either don't provide the full data set (e.g. by providing\na query interface with rate limiting) or are not maintained in a way that we\nconsider helps the community (submission process cumbersome, data not\ncleaned/sanitized,...).\n\nWhat is a TAC?\n\nA Type Allocation Code (TAC) is made up by the first 8 digits of the so-called\nInternational Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) associated with mobile\ndevices. Earlier versions of the 3GPP TS 03.03 specification defined it as 6\nbytes. The TAC is a unique identifier to determine the device manufacturer/model\nand its marketing name. These records are allocated by certain groups and a full\nlist of all IMEIs is maintained by the GSMA.","repo":{"author":"Open Source Mobile Communications","repo":"https://gitea.osmocom.org/osmo-tacdb/"},"version":"17981db7f300f2571d053c01213f06d0011dfefe6f4e94b87af4e53174065200","site":null,"source":"https://gitea.osmocom.org/osmo-tacdb/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
