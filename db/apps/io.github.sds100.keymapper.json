Each trigger can have multiple actions. The keys can be set to be pressed at the same time or one after another in a sequence. Keys can be remapped when they are short pressed, long pressed or double pressed. A keymap can have a set of \"constraints\" so it only has an effect in certain situations.\n\nWhat canâ€™t be remapped?\n * Mouse buttons\n * Thumb sticks or triggers on game controllers\n\nYour key maps do not work if the screen is OFF. This is a limitation in Android. There is nothing the dev can do.\n\nWhat can I remap my keys to do?\nSome actions will only work on rooted devices and specific Android versions.\n\nThere are too many features to list here so check out the full list here: https://docs.keymapper.club/user-guide/actions\n\nPermissions\nYou don't have to grant all the permissions for the app to work. The app will tell you if a permission needs to be granted for a feature to work.\n\n * Accessibility Service: Basic requirement for remapping to work. It is needed so the app can listen to and block key events.\n * Device Admin: To turn the screen off when using the action to turn off the screen.\n * Modify System Settings: To change the brightness and rotation settings.\n * Camera: To control the flashlight.\n\n On some devices, enabling the accessibility service will disable \"enhanced data encryption\".\n\nDiscord: www.keymapper.club\nWebsite: docs.keymapper.club","repo":{"author":"sds100","repo":"https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper"},"version":"971424f659ec286aa70d82561d9445eb73e740f03c2c6d69bee60ac7c650ce9c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
