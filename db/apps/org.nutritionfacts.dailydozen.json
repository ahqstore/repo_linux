Dr.\nGreger's Daily Dozen details the healthiest foods and how many servings of each\nwe should try to check off every day. He explains his rationale in his book\n<a href=\"https://NutritionFacts.org/book\">How Not to Die</a>. All his proceeds from his\nbooks, DVDs, and speaking engagements is all donated to charity.\n\nNutritionFacts.org is a non-commercial, nonprofit, science-based public service\nprovided by Dr. Greger, providing free daily updates on the latest in nutrition\nresearch via bite-sized videos.
