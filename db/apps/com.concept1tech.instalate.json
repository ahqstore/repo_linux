If you're using the floating button don't trigger a translation if sensitive data is located in the system clipboard.</b>\n\nTips and Tricks:\n- If an app has implemented a custom context menu see if the floating button works for you or if the app is able to share text\n- Integration into \"Librera\" (FOSS ebook reader):\n   1. Select any word in the document by long-pressing it (text selection must be supported by the document)\n   2. In the opening dialog tap the \"+\" sign at the bottom and select InstaLate\n   3.
