Want to build a book for you and your kids to learn more about it? Try creating a new book, add some pages by searching for Organism, Animal, Plant, and then Fungi, then watch your book come to life.\n\n<b>Share your creations</b>\nGenerate a PDF and email it to a friend, or print it for your own physical book.\n\n<b>Limitations</b>\nThis is still in the early stages of development. Some things which are on the roadmap:\n<ul><li>Proper attribution for Wikipedia sources in resulting PDFs.</li><li>More intuitive swipe controls (e.g. for changing pages when reading, or for re-ordering pages in a book).</li><li>Select your favourite image(s) from a wiki page instead of being forced to use the one the app selected.</li><li>Sharing of books between Android devices to support remixing and improving others books (rather than just PDF export as we have now).</li></ul>\n\nDonate via <a href=\"https://liberapay.com/BabyDots\">Liberapay</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/pserwylo\">GitHub Sponsors</a> to support further development.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Peter Serwylo","repo":"https://github.com/babydots/babybook"},"version":"89b4e283c76e27453ee0cfcd0052bad2928ea41e674661690162fc85dbf03403","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/babydots/babybook","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
