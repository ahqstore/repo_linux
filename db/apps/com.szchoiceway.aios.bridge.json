When the Phoenix Radio boots (or fast-boots), \nthe Alt Launcher starts the apps it is configured to start. The primary purpose \nis to launch two apps in split screen mode. You can select which app to be on \nthe top half of the screen, and the app for the bottom half. Prior to starting \nthose apps, it can launch services or apps that need to run in the background.\n\nInstallation Note: The Alt Launcher does not show up in the launcher that comes \nwith the Phoenix radios. During the installation process, be sure to click the \n\"Open\" button to run it once. From that point on, it will run in the \nbackground. If you don't start it during the installation process, the only way \nto start it is with another app that launches apps (like CarWebGuru).\n\nAccessing the app\n\nTo get into the Alt Launcher, swipe down from the top of the screen to view \nnotifications, and click on the \"Alt Launcher\" notification. It has the \nmessage \"Foreground Service Started\". If the notification is not available, \nstart the Alt Launcher using a non-stock launcher like CarWebGuru.\n\nIn the main scren, the Alt Launcher displays the services, background apps, and top and bottom apps it is configured to start on booot or fast boot.\n\nBackground Apps\n\nAt the top of the main screen is the list of apps that will start and then be \nput in the background. They are started in the order shown. To add a new one, \nclick the \"Add a new Background App\" button, and select the desired app. To \nremove an app from the list, click on that app.\n\nServices\n\nBelow the background apps is the list of services that will be started. They \nare started in the order shown. To add a new one, click the \"Add New Service to \nStart\" button, and select the desired service. To remove a service, click on \nthe service.\n\nTop and Bottom Apps\n\nBelow the background apps are the two apps to launch in split screen mode. To \nselect the top or bottom app, click on either \"None Selected\" or the app shown \nin either the top or bottom sections, and choose the desired app in the popup.\n\nPermissions\n\nThe app requires the following permissions:\n1. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - needed to be notified after cold boot so it can launch the apps.\n2. FOREGROUND_SERVICE - The default launcher on Phoenix Radios hides the application icon for the Alt Launcher. This means that by default, there is no way to get into the app to update configuration. The foreground service provides a consistent way to get back into the app.\n\nTasker\n\nTo start Tasker so that it starts performing actions after boot, do the \nfollowing:\n\n1. Select the following Tasker service to be launched: \ncom.joaomgcd.taskerm.plugin.ServiceRequestQuery\ni. There is generally no need to launch the Tasker app itself.\n2. In Tasker, if you set up a profile with Profile->Event->Tasker->\nMonitor Start, that activates when Tasker starts up.\n\n\nSee the \n<a href=\"https://github.com/tabletradio/altlauncher/blob/master/README.md\">\nReadme</a> for additional details.\n","repo":{"author":"Tablet Radio","repo":"https://github.com/tabletradio/altlauncher"},"version":"2d34bf80b34cf13c05b1c5c719591689aeffd0ad0a1f5f0ba17261b2d019fbbc","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tabletradio/altlauncher","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
