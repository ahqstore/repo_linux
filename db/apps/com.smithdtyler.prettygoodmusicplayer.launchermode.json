Of music players that ignore Bluetooth controls, or\nstop responding after a few minutes? I was too, so I wrote this app!\n\nFeature Details:\n\n* Audiobook mode for resuming playback where you left off\n* Notification controls\n* The color theme and text size are now configurable!\n* This player protects against accidental pausing when your phone is jostled and the headphone cord shifts. I added this because it was annoying when my phone was in my pocket and would auto-pause because the headphone cable was bumped.\n* Plays .mp3, .m4p, .m4a, .aac, and many more types of audio files.\n* Accepts play, pause, previous, and next commands from Bluetooth headsets.\n* When you select 'All songs' for a given artist, the songs are ordered by album, not alphabetically.\n* Automatically pauses and resumes when another app (e.g. GPS) needs audio.\n* If another app needs audio for more than 30 seconds (e.g. a phone call), it does not automatically resume.\n* \"Repeat All\" is always on.\n* If you click \"back\" too quickly, it double checks that you want to leave before quitting.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/smithdtyler/prettygoodmusicplayer/tree/launchermode"},"version":"f0971c691f12a80a58b2f9acef1404631098ee0c55703e5f3a1b0a56294a1a21","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/smithdtyler/prettygoodmusicplayer/tree/launchermode","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
