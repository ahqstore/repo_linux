This protects the privacy of who you are communicating with, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers.</li>\n  <li><strong>Complete protection against spam and abuse</strong>: as you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address.</li>\n  <li><strong>Full ownership, control and security of your data</strong>: SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received.</li>\n  <li><strong>Decentralized network</strong>: you can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can connect to anybody you know via link or scan QR code (in the video call or in person) and start sending messages instantly - no emails, phone numbers or passwords needed.</p> \n<p>Your profile and contacts are only stored in the app on your device - our servers do not have access to this information.</p>\n<p>All messages are end-to-end encrypted using open-source double-ratchet protocol; the messages are routed via our servers using open-source SimpleX Messaging Protocol.</p>\n<p>Please send us any questions via the app (connect to the team via settings!), <a href=\"mailto:chat@simplex.chat?subject=SimpleX Chat on F-Droid\">email us</a> or submit an <a href=\"https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/issues\" target=\"_blank\">issue on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow us on Mastodon (<a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@simplex\" target=\"_blank\">@simplex@mastodon.social</a>), Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SimpleXChat\" target=\"_blank\">@SimpleXChat</a>) and Reddit (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SimpleXChat/\" target=\"_blank\">r/SimpleXChat</a>) for the latest updates.</p>\n<p>Once you install SimpleX Chat, join the group of users via <a href=\"https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=1-2&smp=smp%3A%2F%2Fu2dS9sG8nMNURyZwqASV4yROM28Er0luVTx5X1CsMrU%3D%40smp4.simplex.im%2FWHV0YU1sYlU7NqiEHkHDB6gxO1ofTync%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-2%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAWbebOqVYuBXaiqHcXYjEHCpYi6VzDlu6CVaijDTmsQU%253D%26srv%3Do5vmywmrnaxalvz6wi3zicyftgio6psuvyniis6gco6bp6ekl4cqj4id.onion&data=%7B%22type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22groupLinkId%22%3A%22mL-7Divb94GGmGmRBef5Dg%3D%3D%22%7D\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a> to share your ideas and feedback.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat"},"version":"d060e0f4a5a81037e8d87f570f41e38a96cd8c7e48ab71d97513acfbac941974","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
