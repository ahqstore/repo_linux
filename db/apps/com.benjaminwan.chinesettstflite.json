It works well on a middle-end device. The Tacotron has high performance requirements. Though the overall effect is better, the speed is very slow. Therefore it's bundled only for test and can't be used in practice.\n","repo":{"author":"benjamin wan","repo":"https://github.com/benjaminwan/ChineseTtsTflite"},"version":"bdc8a50c028b4f0eacd2ab2f22cbbefe8ee00262b25e388cf545c54cbacbc76e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/benjaminwan/ChineseTtsTflite","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
