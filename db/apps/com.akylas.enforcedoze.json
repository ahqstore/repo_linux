Doze will only deactivate\nperiodically to execute maintenance jobs (like getting notifications, etc),\notherwise it will remain active as long as your screen is off. This brings a lot\nmore battery savings than standard Doze functionality, because even with screen\noff and Doze enabled, Doze is still periodically checking for movement, and\ndisabling motion sensing improves battery life further.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Force Doze mode immediately after screen off or after a user specified delay\n* Add/remove apps or packages directly to system Doze whitelist\n* Disable motion sensors to prevent Doze from kicking in during movement\n* Tasker support to turn on/off EnforceDoze and modify other features\n* Disable WiFi and mobile data completely during Doze\n* Ignore disabling Wifi/Data if music is playing\n* Ignore disabling Wifi/Data if hotspot is enabled\n* Enable Doze mode on devices where OEM has disabled it\n* No root mode so you can enjoy the core benefits without rooting your device ","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/farfromrefug/EnforceDoze"},"version":"4ac422037f34996b7f51ee654ae12f93c018bc2b8702354776856cb2a61de5ee","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/farfromrefug/EnforceDoze","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
