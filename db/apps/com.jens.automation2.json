I can test it in the emulator, but that cannot show all bugs.\nSo if a certain feature is not working on your device - let me know. Over the years I have fixed almost all bugs that have been reasonably reported to me. But for that I'm dependend on your input.\n\nIf you have a problem and think about contacting me please\n- update to the latest version first and see if your problem persists there, too.\n- check this list of known problems first: https://server47.de/automation/index.php#knownProblems\n\nDonations are certainly a good, but not the only way to motivate me :-)\n* If you'd like to support me, you can also leave a positive review for the app on Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jens.automation2).\n* If you like the app, simply some warm words via email are always appreciated.\n* Furthermore I can always use help in translating the app. English, German and some Spanish are among my own skills. Italiano e russo sono già coperti. But everything else is more than welcome.\n* If you have a talent/experience in graphics design and have some ideas for nicer icons let me know.\n* If you have an interesting use-case or found a way to combine triggers and actions to achieve something intriguing and you think it's worth putting it on the examples page (https://server47.de/automation/examples.html), let me know.\n\nExplanation of the many permissions can be found here: https://server47.de/automation/permissions.php","repo":{"author":"Jens Schröder","repo":"https://git.server47.de/jens/Automation"},"version":"c157456dfca9b54f555fd24e5f5c7993c0418237b6d286e82c301fbbc6a470c5","site":null,"source":"https://git.server47.de/jens/Automation","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
