This app is the barcode decoder (receiver). An encoder (sender) can be seen at <a href='https://cimbar.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar.org</a>.\n\nWith <i>CameraFileCopy</i> it is possible to receive data over the camera as a one-way data channel. It does not use any antennas (wifi, bluetooth, nfc, ...) or other tricks. Notably, this means it works just as well in airplane mode.\n\nThe app reads animated <a href='https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar codes</a>. Nearly all the interesting logic is from libcimbar – included via a git subtree. The sender component of cfc is a cimbar encoder -- such as <a href='https://cimbar.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar.org</a>. Navigate to that website (or use libcimbar's <code>cimbar_send</code> to generate barcodes natively), open a file to initialize the cimbar stream, and point the app+camera at the animated barcode.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/sz3/cfc"},"version":"30c08e4d62c8480c416b76be24dfa848e7cf89679d1d69cf7fc7250f04255b97","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/sz3/cfc","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
