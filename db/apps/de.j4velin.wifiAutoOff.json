It is designed to be used with WiFi-only tablets\n- these devices normally don't require a constant internet connection if you're\nnot using them and turning WiFi off can save a lot of battery power.\n\nYou can also specify to automatically turn on WiFi again, if you turn on your\ndevice. This way, you are always connected to your WiFi network when using the\nthe tablet.\n\nThis app has a similiar effect like setting the \"WiFi sleep policy\" in Android\nto \"always\", except that you can now exactly define the timeout between turning\nthe screen off and actually turning off WiFi.\n\nIf your device has a cell radio, it might switch to 2G/3G which may consume more\npower than staying on WiFi.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/j4velin/WiFi-Automatic"},"version":"76c0c1b51075f901e019d91c1643019442e9359966d5deaba182762ff270d5cc","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/j4velin/WiFi-Automatic","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
