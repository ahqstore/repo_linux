It can take her from a distressed state to happy and content almost immediately. We started showing baby dots from 10 weeks old, and it still worked well at 8 months old.\n\nAs they grow older, use the child lock so that those little fingers can safely touch the dots as they move around to make them change.\n\nWorks at home and on the go.\n\nAlthough it may not work for every baby, we hope it helps yours.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/babydots/babydots"},"version":"61cdf7910f8ee0def40c8c031b198bd3199996b5a2c51e2c53b44a0cf0f2d958","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/babydots/babydots","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
