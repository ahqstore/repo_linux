(and You\n(and You (and You (and...))))\n\nExperience an all new kind of running game!\n\nUsed to play until being hit by an obstacle? You'll play for 90 seconds each\ngame.\n\nUsed to control 1 running hero? We'll give you 10 of them. The trick? You\ncontrol them one at a time, and when you're done with one, he will do the same\nrun over and over and continue to score points for you.\n\nThe challenge is to score with your current hero while avoiding your previous\nones - if you hit one of them he will disappear forever.","repo":{"author":"Soupe au Caillou","repo":"https://github.com/SoupeauCaillou/recursive-runner"},"version":"90f35b9d10760aa979e6449dc13f71f10b153866ac2e3fd798a4b7d2a98373a0","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SoupeauCaillou/recursive-runner","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
