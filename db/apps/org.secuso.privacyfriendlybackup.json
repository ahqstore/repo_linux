The app allows you to create and manage backups. This includes importing backups into the app and exporting backups to external storage media. \nThe Privacy Friendly Backup app communicates with other Privacy Friendly apps and extracts or injects data into and out of the app to enable the creation and restoration of backups.\n\nThe app provides encryption via an interface to another app that provides encryption as functionality via the openpgp-api. The user is free to choose their own encryption provider via the app's settings.\nFor encryption to work, the provider must be installed externally. We recommend https://www.openkeychain.org/ , as this app is available in the regular PlayStore as well as in the F-Droid Store and is completely open source.\n\nYou can reach us via\nTwitter - @SECUSOResearch https://twitter.com/secusoresearch\nMastodon - @SECUSO_Research@baw√º.social https://xn--baw-joa.social/@SECUSO_Research/\nJob opening - https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/english/Job_Offers_1557.php\n","repo":{"author":"SECUSO - Security Usability Society","repo":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-backup"},"version":"a2da9ba66f0fa76469a16dc369579d2afa22a7c33309736f51a8356e90a40d5b","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-backup","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
