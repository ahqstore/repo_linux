This tool allows you to monitor notifications from any\napplications which are important for you and perform sound reminder\nperiodically.\n\nJust launch app, allow it to receive notification events, select reminder\ninterval and important applications. That's it. If there are any unhandled\nnotifications from thet selected apps in the statusbar, app will notify you\nperiodically with the notification sound you choose.\n\nThe battery is used only if there are missed notifications which requires\nperiodical reminder. App wakes phone to perform sound notification and then\nsleep again.","repo":{"author":"Eugene Popovich","repo":"https://github.com/httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder"},"version":"0c6406ba11a0e88cefc3a3f138de20e6ef42df080b5eeda41a47ab7822099a4c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/httpdispatch/MissedNotificationsReminder","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
