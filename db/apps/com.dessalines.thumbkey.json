Its easy to learn, and designed for fast typing speeds.\n\nInstead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses <b>large keys with predictable positions</b>, to prevent your eyes from hunting and pecking for letters.\n\nAs the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of touch-typing, your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.\n\nThis project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) <a href=\"https://www.exideas.com/ME/\">MessagEase Keyboard</a>, which is its main inspiration.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key"},"version":"438fc91bfc2c28be8e1b09cabbc36522c6e589975de9685648735f3435e862b8","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
