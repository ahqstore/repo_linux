With easy log search, you can search the logs using application name, package name, version name, hash or checksum. Also view and easily copy hashes or checksums of the logged applications (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512). Detect and know silent updates or modifications by other applications (ex: Google Play Services) by checking the logs. This application should auto-log when there is an installation or an update (except when stopped by means of force stop), but if you want you can also run it manually at any convenient time.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/seoulcodingcafe/Installalogs"},"version":"4ca73fccb2415f761ecd6d79e76f9fe4f585855dc0e2e75977ba0423d01ee4c8","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/seoulcodingcafe/Installalogs","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
