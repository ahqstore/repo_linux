Nitro. Action! SuperTuxKart is a 3D open-source arcade racer with a\nvariety of characters, tracks, and modes to play. Our aim is to create a\ngame that is more fun than realistic, and provide an enjoyable experience\nfor all ages.\n\nDiscover the mystery of an underwater world, or drive through the jungles\nof Val Verde and visit the famous Cocoa Temple. Race underground or in a\nspaceship, through a rural farmland or a strange alien planet.\nOr rest under the palm trees on the beach, watching the other karts\novertake you. But don't eat the bananas! Watch for bowling balls,\nplungers, bubble gum, and cakes thrown by your opponents.\n\nYou can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several\nGrand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play\nbattle mode against the computer or your friends, and more! For a greater\nchallenge, race online against players from all over the world and prove\nyour racing prowess!","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code"},"version":"b6469d2888970b0c87df0c9eb472ea7d12f331f57f7623c6769986209e830a2f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/supertuxkart/stk-code","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
