The VM heap size Android supports is either 16 or 24\nmegs, so we can't fit the whole thing in memory at once. To overcome this,\nWorldApp uses the BitmapRegionDecoder API (available as of Android 2.3.3) to\ndecode just what it needs to display. The app can also serve as a viewer for\narbitrary images opened via a (3rd-party) file manager.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/johnnylambada/WorldMap"},"version":"4a0fef6e48da977d2ec5a6245445f872d3c5e90d054b67366639a519f93a87f1","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/johnnylambada/WorldMap","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
