Dark, black and dynamic color themes are available.\n\nThe user input is interpreted by specific, yet reusable, libraries: <a href=\"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-sentences-compiler\">dicio-sentences-compiler</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-numbers\">dicio-numbers</a>.\n\nThis app has the <i>NonFreeNet</i> anti-feature because some skills use non-free services to obtain the information requested by the user. You can easily disable unwanted skills or choose alternative services via settings.\n","repo":{"author":"Stypox","repo":"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android"},"version":"b1c67a04dbfe1783b40d90cf6e2c2f38fe715e5425a6a124402133f89632b3f6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
