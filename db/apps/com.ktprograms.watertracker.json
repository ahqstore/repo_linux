The glasses go down from full to empty at each tap. Alarm of your chosen duration (re)starts every time you touch a glass.\n\nA 'Drink water!' notification will be displayed if you have not 'drank' for your chosen duration. Tapping the notification goes to the app.\n\nWhen all 5 glasses are empty, the notifications will no longer come (until you restart them), and a 'Congratulations' message will appear.\n","repo":{"author":"ktprograms","repo":"https://github.com/ktprograms/WaterTracker"},"version":"ccd6744be2da9109d4d446075c25efcbaa6f8913a48908df8692b479d2a453a2","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ktprograms/WaterTracker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
