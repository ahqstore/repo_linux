You\ncan filter by address, and optionally add parts that must occur in the message\nfor it to be blocked.\n\nBy default, SMS Filter will not delete incoming messages. You will get a silent\nstatus bar notification when SMS Filter has filtered an incoming message, which\nyou can view by opening the notification or by opening the application.\n\nYou can also tell SMS Filter to delete incoming messages, in which case it will\nhappily do so for you. To do this, just turn off the 'Save messages' preference.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://purl.archive.org/net/smsfilter/source"},"version":"ee05b30ba21e16432bef3e2892638acbbca8f3dabdea369e47c59fae3f2e3bbd","site":null,"source":"https://purl.archive.org/net/smsfilter/source","license_or_tos":"Fair","resources":null,"verified":false}
