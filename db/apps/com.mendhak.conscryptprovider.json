I'm putting it on F-Droid in case it benefits others too.","repo":{"author":"Mendhak","repo":"https://github.com/mendhak/Conscrypt-Provider"},"version":"08ef2e7d0bdfe4aa9c6399ada96b694ace3aa32d6cf8c90fe80320b534ec5126","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mendhak/Conscrypt-Provider","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
