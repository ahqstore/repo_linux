No profile can access the apps, app data or files of another profile,  but that also means that there's no easy way for for users of profiles to exchange information.\n\nWith this App you'll be able to select which information you'd like to share with other profiles on the same device. Notifications about the shared data will be shown in the other profiles allowing you to download, share or copy it from the profile the data is located in.\n\nAll inter-profile communications happen locally without requiring an Internet connection, the use of servers, or involvement of 3rd party services.\n\nNo Ads. No Tracking. No In-App Purchases. Free Open Source Software.","repo":{"author":"Ventral Digital LLC","repo":"https://github.com/VentralDigital/InterProfileSharing"},"version":"fef560704ddea1fda6709e3793d6955dcee62d7441edf575eebfdc3b0612055f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VentralDigital/InterProfileSharing","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
