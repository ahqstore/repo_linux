With <em>DevQS</em>, Developer Options can be toggled off then back on from the Quick Settings panel without resetting other settings. Long-clicking on any of the tiles will also open the Developer Options settings screen if the DEV toggle is on.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThere is no launcher icon nor activity. The tiles must be manually added to the Quick Settings panel. The app requires the permission WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS which can be granted using ADB.\n<blockquote><tt>adb shell pm grant me.velc.devqs android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</tt></blockquote>","repo":{"author":"Louie Velarde","repo":"https://github.com/louie-velarde/DevQS"},"version":"46aecb316c08001024f10330af823c97de4d42bf386043d935692abf8a537eb9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/louie-velarde/DevQS","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
