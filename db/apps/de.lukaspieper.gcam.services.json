Note that this app comes without UI and therefore has no icon in the app drawer. But of course it is listed in the Android settings (e.g. for uninstallation).\n\n<b>It is strongly recommended to read the project page to learn more about compatibility and limitations.</b>\n\nThis app is NOT compatible with devices running Google Play Services or microg, installation will fail on these devices. Also, the original Gcam (unmodded) version 7.6 or newer requires a compatible Android version (OS/ROM). More information about this on the project page as well.\n\nProject page:\nhttps://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider","repo":{"author":"Lukas Pieper","repo":"https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider"},"version":"8fb95c15eb4b374e8f0e3650e942b962f47f18bc36ee1d62ffa2fb53c9e1de9a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
