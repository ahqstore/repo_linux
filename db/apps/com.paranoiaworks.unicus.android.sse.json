Use the internal database or just copy/paste to/from your favorite applications. A password is set for the current encryption/decryption session, and you may have an unlimited number of passwords for any purpose (notes, emails, social networking, communication with persons A, B, C, â€¦).\nðŸŽ¥ ~ <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IK9Sxqr0uJU\">text encryption video tutorial</a>\n\nâž¤ <b>Password Vault:</b> Store and manage all passwords, PINs, and notes in one secure place protected by one master password. Import/Export function is available (compressed, fully encrypted .pwv file format or unencrypted, editable .xml file format).\n\nâ€¢ Algorithms: Everything is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms: AES (Rijndael) 256bit, RC6 256bit, Serpent 256bit, Blowfish 448bit, Twofish 256bit, GOST 256bit + Threefish 1024bit, SHACAL-2 512bit and Paranoia C4 2048bit (for S.S.E. Pro Version) ciphers are available.\nâ€¢ Steganography: Text Encryptor contains a steganographic feature (concealing a text within an image - JPG). A steganographic algorithm (F5 algorithm) is used in combination with chosen symmetric cipher algorithm to make a final steganogram (JPEG image).\nâ€¢ Other Utils: Password Generator, Clipboard Cleaner, Algorithm Benchmark, â€¦\nâ€¢ Cross-platform desktop versions (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, â€¦) of Text Encryptor and File Encryptor are available on: <a href=\"https://paranoiaworks.mobi\">https://paranoiaworks.mobi</a>\nâ€¢ Paranoia Text Encryption for iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod) is available.\nâ€¢ An online (web-based) version of Text Encryptor (AES, client-side JavaScript) is available on: <a href=\"https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi\">https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi</a>","repo":{"author":"Paranoia Works","repo":"https://gitlab.com/paranoia-works/secret-space-encryptor-for-android"},"version":"bed50c04c803adca36e7eb67828f28865b0348f65536127fbc5ca74a583478a0","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/paranoia-works/secret-space-encryptor-for-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
