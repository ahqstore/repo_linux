Multiple widgets can be added, and they will have separate calendar selection settings.\n\nIt is relatively simple, at least by Android project standards, and attempts to use the standard practices for each part. By default, it has no calendar permissions, and so it will be in \"screenshot mode\" (which was also used to prepare the app widget preview).\n\nSource Code (GPLv2): https://github.com/jasongyorog/PolyCal\nPrivacy Policy: http://gyorog.com/PolyCal-privacy.html\n","repo":{"author":"Jason Gyorog","repo":"https://github.com/jasongyorog/PolyCal"},"version":"3fba5df718e4e61f647072e0f59e887b9de8462c2ce2c8a079600fcfec24040f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jasongyorog/PolyCal","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
