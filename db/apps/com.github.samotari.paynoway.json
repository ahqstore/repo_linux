Most of the end-user applications used widely today leave their users vulnerable to being defrauded via double-spend attacks. PayNoWay is a tool that you can use to test the applications that you, or your business, depend on to accept on-chain cryptocurrency payments.\n\nFeatures:\n- Send payment transactions with the same UX flow as other wallet applications.\n- Easily broadcast double-spend transaction after a payment is sent, to return the funds to the internal wallet address.\n- Fetch current network fee rate, or set a custom value.\n- Optionally set automatic broadcasting of double-spend transactions.\n- Control what happens to the payment transaction output - \"Drop it\" or \"Replace with dust\".\n- By default double-spend transactions are broadcast to several web services simultaneously to improve chances of confirmation.\n- Bitcoin mainnet and testnet networks\n- Several address types - Legacy (p2pkh), SegWit backwards compatible, SegWit (bech32).\n- Transaction history view where you can re-broadcast any past transaction, copy to clipboard any transaction as raw hexadecimal, or update any locally stored transaction by fetching it from the configured web service.\n- Statistics dashboard (Payments vs. Double-spends) which shows total number of transactions as well as their total values. Optionally reset the dashboard at any time.\n\nDisclaimers:\n- This app is intended to be used for testing and educational purposes.\n- Please do not use this app to double-spend against merchants without their explicit consent.\n- A successful double-spend is not guaranteed - use at your own risk.\n- You are responsible for creating a backup of your private key(s). Without a backup, if you delete the app or lose your device, your funds will be permanently lost.\n\nPermissions:\n- Camera, flashlight - To scan QR codes that contain an on-chain addresses, payment requests, and optionally a private key (WIF) during configuration.\n- Access network state - For detecting if the device is offline. This helps provide feedback to you, the user, in case of temporary loss of network connectivity.\n- Internet - To query web service APIs to broadcast transactions, fetch minimum relay fee rate, fetch transaction history and unspent transaction outputs.","repo":{"author":"Charles Hill","repo":"https://github.com/samotari/paynoway"},"version":"a1ebc88ece1a313ffcaa5b6b880a316d1a4bcd4ee1bf0073306b50933cbfc19d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/samotari/paynoway","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
