This means that no proprietary server-side component is necessary: use any server-side component that implements these standards â€” for example FreeIPA, which uses TOTP.\nAny standards-compliant implementation will work.\nCurrently, FreeOTP provides implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus"},"version":"6ffa77a9cd2e463866ce14800adffc47c0ad0f600746064e0bbf1e72dde973e7","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
