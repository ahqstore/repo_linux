Well I for sure\nunderstand this problem to the heart. But fear no more, as BootBoi is here to save you from the gruesome task of standing up\nand pushing a button.\n\nBootBoi features remote power on / power off / reboot for as many remote machines as you can imagine with the\ncombined power of SSH and Wake On Lan.\n\nPreparing your Remote Machine\n* Before you can use BootBoi with your remote machines, you have to prepare them for **remote** rebooting and powering them on/off.\n\nPower On\n* To power a remote device on, BootBoi uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN\">Wake On Lan</a>.\n* This needs to be enabled in the BIOS of the machine you want to power on, read more <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/wake-on-lan-4149800\">here</a>.\n\nPower Off / Reboot\n* BootBoi uses <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">SSH</a> to execute whoami, poweroff and reboot on the remote machine.\n* So make sure that\n    * Those binaries are available and in $PATH\n    * The SSH user has sudo access to whoami, poweroff and reboot\n        * Either by allowing the user sudo access only to those binaries via the <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/5/sudoers\">sudoers file</a> (recommended)\n            * E.g. `echo \"my_ssh_user ALL=(ALL) /sbin/reboot,/sbin/poweroff,/usr/bin/whoami\" >> /etc/local/sudoers`\n        * Or by using root as SSH user in BootBoi\n","repo":{"author":"Elektropepi","repo":"https://github.com/BootBoi/android-app"},"version":"b5beda628a133cdbf4b4e1dd949739ca0a57c04c11db983a436caafb99964a11","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/BootBoi/android-app","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
