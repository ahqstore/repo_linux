It can be used also when offline.\n\nThis app is a viewer for passes - a pass could be a e.g. boarding-pass for your\nnext flight, a coupon for a nice hot beverage on the destination, a movie\nticket, a membership card - there are a lot of possibilities. Basically it is a\nreplacement for a piece of paper or plastic you would normally have to carry\nwith you - so lets save some trees and reduce waste!\n\n<b>How does it work?</b>\n\nThere are so called espass or pkpass files - you can open them with this app -\ne.g. when you receive them via email or get an Download-option. The most\nimportant content is the BarCode ( QR , AZTEC & PDF417which authorizes you most\nof the time - but it also has other interesting content like a description -\noften a time ( that you now can add to your calendar ) - often also locations (\nto give you directions ) - just try It out! The app is offline usable once you\ndownloaded the pass!","repo":{"author":"ligi","repo":"https://github.com/ligi/PassAndroid"},"version":"1b2f35f99dff9c26812c3650b6c2754dabd85b024dcd692e6f2c3aea698b8bda","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ligi/PassAndroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
