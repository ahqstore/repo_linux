All you need to do is press the buttons in the right order. It's harder than it looks.</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Background</b><br/>\n    The chimp test, also known as the Ayumu memory test, is a test designed to assess working memory.<br/>\n    It was popularized by a study conducted at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan, where chimpanzees demonstrated remarkable short-term memory abilities.<br/>\n    Chimps seem to, effectively, have a photographic memory (eidetic memory).\n    <br/>\n    Untrained humans generally perform significantly worse than chimpanzees on the chimp test. So, this app trains you. The hope is that we can eventually match or beat chimp records.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Gameplay</b>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Numbers from 1 to 9 are displayed randomly</li>\n        <li>You must memorize the positions of the numbers</li>\n        <li>Once you press <b>1</b>, all buttons display a <b>?</b></li>\n        <li>You need to then use your memory to press <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>,..., <b>9</b></li>\n        <li>It's game over if you press the wrong button thrice.</li>\n    </ul>\n</p>","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/hathibelagal-dev/Eidetic-Memory-Trainer"},"version":"f24eed5097a0fb3bc507bd4d282307600bbddb3bb4491cb428fa73c2f6eca634","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/hathibelagal-dev/Eidetic-Memory-Trainer","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
