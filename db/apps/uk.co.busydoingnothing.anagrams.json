When any player sees a word in the jumble of letters they can take it. You can also steal a word from another player if you add another letter and rearrange their word to make an anagram. Can you spot anagrams faster than your friends?\n","repo":{"author":"Neil Roberts","repo":"https://github.com/bpeel/verda-sxtelo"},"version":"9247c2abfa0d8e5b5e665dbc7cdf3eb559dec7fc19639b3ae0fd67f89a77966d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bpeel/verda-sxtelo","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
