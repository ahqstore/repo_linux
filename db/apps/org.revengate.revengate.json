Meet locals and investigate mysteries through role-playing and dungeon exploration. With quirky items like the potion of absinthe and the potion of analysis-paralysis, you will have to apply novel strategies and tactics to overcome your challenges.\n\nSupported languages: English (only one laguage for now).\n\nThe game takes a lot of inspiration from Nethack and other traditional roguelikes while keeping actions simple to make the controls more mobile-friendly. The control scheme borrows a lot ideas from the excellent UI in Pixel Dungeon and its Shattered Pixel variant.\n\nYou can also play Revengate in your browser: https://ygingras.itch.io/revengate\n\nThis free and open source game is made with the Godot Game Engine. Revengate has no ads, no micro transactions, and can be played offline.\n","repo":{"author":"Yannick Gingras","repo":"https://gitlab.com/ygingras/revengate"},"version":"fd5a43c36acb95b7264ee4bc178f575c9c5cedcf9864fc999c13406fa15bebac","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/ygingras/revengate","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
