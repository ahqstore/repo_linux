Visit\nthe campaign website to</b> <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/speak-freely\nsupport\">the cause</a>.\n\n<b>N.B</b> The app no longer asks for root by default although you can still try\nit in adhoc mode. Prebuilts are no longer in the source code.\n\nThis is <b>experimental software</b>: it may not work as advertised. It may lose\nor alter messages and files that it carries; it may consume a lot of space,\nspeed and battery, and it may crash unexpectedly.\n\nMobile communications are useful, but depend on infrastructure that can be\ndamaged, overwhelmed, or even absent. This app assumes zero infrastructure. The\nphones talk to each other using WiFi; relaying calls and messages and figuring\nout how to resolve numbers. In other words, it lets your phone communicate with\nother Android phones running Serval Mesh within WiFi range.\n\nRequires root: No. Basic Android still doesn't allow WiFi in AdHoc mode, so the\napp will ask for root if you try to enable adhoc mode.\n\nThe Java/XML part is distributable under the GNU GPLv3 while the serval-dna\n(distributed number architecture) project is GPLv2.","repo":{"author":"The Serval Project","repo":"https://github.com/servalproject/batphone"},"version":"8f22be2b37fad7f3c8629c8e9324eeaf3bea2a00b420e5b3f47d612a69064728","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/servalproject/batphone","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
