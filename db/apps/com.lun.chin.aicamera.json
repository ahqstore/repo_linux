It can also gray out the background leaving only the recognised object in colour.\nThe app uses a convolutional neural network to perform the detection. A TensorFlow implementation of the neural network can be found <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/chlun/shufflesegmentation/src/master/\">here</a>. It was trained on a dataset of images consisting of people, cats and dogs and the trained model then exported as a protobuf file which contains the graph definition and the trained weights.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://bitbucket.org/chlun/aicamera"},"version":"e3de39fdfbe499faa7c41a2a0a88acfffd9f6edc7fa38f2a4ca002393b76f2be","site":null,"source":"https://bitbucket.org/chlun/aicamera","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
