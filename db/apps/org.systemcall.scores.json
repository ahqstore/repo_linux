On either of them, you can\nadd/delete people, change the maximum score and choose between win or lose at\nthat score.\n\nFor example, on Uno, you can set the maximum score at 200 and set it to lose, so\nthat when someone crosses the 200 barrier, the game ends and a \"LOOSER\" banner\nappear alongside the name who lost.\n\nDuring the game, a number box will be available for you to input the points\naccumulated, with ENTER changing down for the next, and an empty box being the\nsame as zero points. After updating all scores, click on the update button.\n\nThe app will save the data (names, score, win/lose) of your last game, so you\ncan re-use it later via the \"Last Game\" button.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":""},"version":"e3bf60df6a91c694b5a38cb42ee63eb32a5d2dc8629789834d877bea1a4ca00a","site":null,"source":null,"license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
