Once you have completed one activity, you have to set a timer for the next one, even if it's a \"sleeping\" activity.\n\nThis time-tracking approach provides real 24/7 data on how long everything takes. You can see it on the Chart screen. It's always surprising.\n\nBy default, the app contains the activities that I use: meditation, work, music, personal development, exercises, walk, getting ready, sleep / rest, other. That's all I need, but you can change it.\n","repo":{"author":"timeto.me","repo":"https://github.com/Medvedev91/timeto.me"},"version":"7fedb31b621f59481bc924aeb2fc80965c29e71494bb998a2f5f29106b83249e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Medvedev91/timeto.me","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
