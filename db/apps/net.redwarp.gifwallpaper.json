Enjoy your new wallpaper!\n\nThe application stands out: \n- No need for root rights, small file size (<3MB)\n- Stops automatically when the wallpaper is not visible or the device is locked, thereby not consuming battery power.\n- And of course, no ads, and will not share your data or gather informations!\n\nSource available on https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper\n\nInterested in using it in your own language? Contact me if you would like to help with the translations!\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Can I set a different GIF for the home screen and the lock screen?\nA: Sorry, it's not possible: this is one of the limitation of Live Wallpapers, you can only apply to both. On some phones, they don't even run on lock screens!\n","repo":{"author":"Benoit Vermont","repo":"https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper"},"version":"3f923547f91f9559227d40eb7f6e59223ba05ba80d9d1e7c870801e3a7dddffa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
