It uses pm command to disable or enable components, requires root permissions.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n\n* Disable or enable components(receivers/services/activities) easily\n* Block a broadcast so that no app can receive it to wake itself\n* Block the bad Keep-Alive services of some apps without errors\n* No data collection\n* Efficient and simple interface\n\n<b>Why not IFW?</b>\n\nIn version 2.0, Watt has completely abandoned disabling components through the Intent Firewall, because ifw will cause android10+ devices to keep restarting. In view of this poor performance, Watt 2.0 uses pm commands to refactor the entire application.\n","repo":{"author":"tuyafeng","repo":"https://github.com/tuyafeng/Watt"},"version":"e637482b3c1d15b859bc0b16188947d82401fc83a6a1571ee66834de29d27de5","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tuyafeng/Watt","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
