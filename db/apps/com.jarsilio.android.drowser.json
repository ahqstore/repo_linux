This is a <i>very</i> impolite way of stopping apps. These might (and probably will) misbehave. You might also lose data because of this. <b>Beware!</b>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/drowser/tree/HEAD"},"version":"1d596b26c5f7366479d3e019b962569a2d34b3b043241975877c9c5b01353b78","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/drowser/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
