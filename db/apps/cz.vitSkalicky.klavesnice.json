Caron an acute keys are added to the right of the keyboard\nfor faster typing. The diacritic keys best fit Czech language, but are\nsuitable for any language that uses them. Unfortunately auto-correction\nis broken and I am unable to fix (I tried. A lot).\n\nAs a bonus I also added swipe control, that allows you to precisely\nnavigate throughout the text.\n\nMain features:\n\n* Caron and acute keys for faster typing\n* Suitable for any language, that uses diacritics (Czech, Slovak, ...)\n* Precise navigation in text by swiping across the keyboard\n* Material design","repo":{"author":"Vít Skalický","repo":"https://github.com/vitSkalicky/klavesnice/"},"version":"820d94c310a57c8d247d22280cd052b2dfdaf2329e17d15a84cf3f191052e087","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/vitSkalicky/klavesnice/","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
