If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.\n\nYou can link Briar with a device running Briar Mailbox (even on Android: https://f-droid.org/packages/org.briarproject.mailbox/) to receive encrypted messages from your contacts while Briar is offline.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar"},"version":"3eeddd867eb7dc97f3ea8beb46871bf4428f476ff91b001b19af347efdec7490","site":null,"source":"https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
