This will affect all tasks that belong to that category.\nUnused categories can be deleted. I.e. deletion is only possible if the category has no tasks, and if it is not used in the current filter.\n\n<b>Filtering tasks:</b>\nIt is possible to restrict the tasks displayed in the list, e.g. completed tasks only, or tasks with low priority only, etc.\nIn general, the tasks to be displayed in the list can be filtered by\n* completion_status\n* due_date/due_time\n* priority\n* category\nor any combination of these.\n\nFor due_date there are several predefined filter options, e.g. TODAY, CURRENT_WEEK, OVERDUE, TASKS_WITHOUT_DATE, etc.\n\nFor priority and category, it is possible to filter with more than one option. E.g. you can choose to show tasks with priorities HIGH or MEDIUM. Or you can display all tasks that have either category \"Family\" or \"Friends\".\n\n<b>Sorting tasks:</b>\nThe task list can be sorted by:\n* completion_status\n* due_date/due_time\n* priority\n* category\n* name\nAny sort order is possible. E.g. first by due_date/time, then by completion status, category, priority and name. Or any other order you prefer.\n\n<b>Searching tasks:</b>\nTasks can be searched by text. The search text you enter can be applied to the task name, the task description, or both.\nCase-sensitive search is possible.\nIn the list of search results, when displaying details of a task, the search string is highlighted in the task name and / or description.\n\n<b>Convenience:</b>\nThere are shortcuts for often used actions. E.g.\n* From the context menu of a category you can jump to a list of all tasks for that category.\n* From the context menu of a task you can change its completion_status, set it to DONE (or OPEN respectively), or set its due date to today or tomorrow.\n* When the task list is filtered by \"tasks due TODAY\", you can easily move to the previous / next day by swiping right / left.\n* Similarly, by swiping you can easily move to the previous / next week (when the task list is filtered by \"tasks due CURRENT_WEEK\"), or to the previous / next category (when all tasks for a category are displayed).\n\n<b>Display:</b>\nTasks due in the past, today, or in the future have different background colors, so they are easily discernible.\nThe color scheme adapts to the display mode of the underlying android. I.e. if dark mode is selected (provided your android does support dark mode), a dark color scheme is used also for toodoo.\n\n<b>Import / Export:</b>\nAll user data (i.e. tasks, categories, filters and sort criteria) can be exported to an external file (xml-format).\nVice versa, data can be imported from an external file.\n\n<b>Technical:</b>\nYour data is stored locally on your device.\nNo connection to the internet needed.\nNo ads. No tracking.\n\n\n<b>Restrictions</b>\ntoodoo is minimalistic. It focuses on managing, categorizing, filtering, and sorting tasks (however, more features may be added in future releases.)\nThus, there are some restriction, i.e.:\n\n* The user interface is in English only.\n\n* Name of folder and file for export data are fixed (i.e. /Download/toodoo/toodooData-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss)\n\n* Settings are currently fixed, e.g.\n- date format is yyyy-mm-dd, time format is 24 hours.\n- first day of week is Monday.\n- within a day, tasks without due_time are sorted behind tasks with due_time.\n","repo":{"author":"wattwurm","repo":"https://gitlab.com/wattwurm/toodo1"},"version":"ecd874dd2f055d0ddf6437c24509db880ffd0c993981c6c7da291e047311ef31","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/wattwurm/toodo1","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
