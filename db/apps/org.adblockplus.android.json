Without needing root, it uses a proxy\nfeature that comes with Android 3.1+ to block ads over WiFi ; but if your phone\ncomes with extra proxy settings (e.g. Samsung or Custom ROMs), it can be\nconfigured for Android 3.0 and below. Instructions are provided in the app or on\ntheir <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/en/android-config\">website</a>.\n\nRequires root: No. Without root it uses a local proxy to filter ads for all apps\n<b>over WiFi only</b> ; if you allow root the app can edit the hosts file too and\nblock ads on cellular data access points.\n\nWe are unable to publish newer versions of this app since upstream pushes lots\nof prebuilt binaries to the source repo.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplusandroid"},"version":"88065ed2b4ba8aa46902ec88a17ece110d234d50197dd19bfbf66ef88301fc52","site":null,"source":"https://hg.adblockplus.org/adblockplusandroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
