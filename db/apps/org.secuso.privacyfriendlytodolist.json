This application allows to create lists of tasks which can be individually managed. Each list contains a set of tasks. Each task can have a deadline, a reminder time and a list of subtasks. By setting a reminder time the user will be informed by a notification. It is possible to display all tasks in a calendar, to protect the app with a secret pin and to sort and prioritize tasks within a list. Colors indicate the urgency of a task (taking the deadline into account).\n\nFeatures of Privacy Friendly To-Do List\n\n1. PIN protection\nOpen the Settings menu to setup a PIN protection for your application. The PIN needs to be a number with 4 digits. You are asked for it every time you start the application / start the main view.\n\n2. Reminder\nYou can set a reminder to your tasks that will notify you if a deadline is approaching. Settings provide you the possibility to enable a notification sound.\n\n3. Widget\nIn addition, this app provides a widget that you can add to your device’s home screen. The widget presents you tasks that belong to a chosen list. Clicking on a task or its checkbox leads to the main view of Privacy Friendly To-Do List.\n\n4. Progress by subtasks\nBy default, progress can be chosen freely by the user when creating or editing a task. To-Do List gives the opportunity to automatically compute and show the progress of a task dependent on its done subtasks. Therefore go to Settings and enable progress by subtasks.\n\nOur Privacy Friendly App differs from other applications with respect to three aspects:\n\n1) Minimal permissions\nPrivacy Friendly To-Do List does not use more permissions than are strictly necessary to provide its functionality.\n\n2) No advertisement\nPrivacy Friendly To-Do List completely relinquishes advertisement.\nMany other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising which also shortens battery life.\n\n3) No tracking\nPrivacy Friendly To-Do List does not use any trackers.\n\nPrivacy Friendly To-Do List is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
