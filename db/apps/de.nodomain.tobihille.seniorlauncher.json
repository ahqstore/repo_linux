(911 and 112 for calling the ambulance is translated of course)\n\nWhy is MMS used for images?\n* Because it is available everywhere and every phone has an app installed that can use it\n* Because it is the only way (that I found out) to direct the user right to the newest images\n\nI recommend the use of https://f-droid.org/packages/com.moez.QKSMS as a SMS/MMS app because it\ncopies all images automatically to the gallery and because it's free.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/tobihille/SeniorLauncher"},"version":"1e3ace3adf7b84dea0a0a7d9c1d63e94a26c68cca74832828164b1e935e08eff","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tobihille/SeniorLauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
