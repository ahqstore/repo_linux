It's a pretty niche UnifiedPush distributor mostly useful for development purposes and advanced users at this moment.\n\nTo work, it needs a static address even with the roaming. It is achievable with a custom network such as a VPN (eg. wireguard) or the yggdrasil network.\n\nFor more information about UnifiedPush, visit https://unifiedpush.org\n\n","repo":{"author":"NoProvider2Push","repo":"https://github.com/NoProvider2Push/android"},"version":"f44ed604e933a6acf308f659db16ed4e7af82f9adb46abc4f599948c481bd133","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/NoProvider2Push/android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
