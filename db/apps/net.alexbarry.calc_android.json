This avoids the need to count brackets to make sure the equation was entered correctly. Also includes LaTeX code generation.\n* complex number support, in rectangular or polar form (e.g. `3 + 4i` or `1 angle 90`)\n* variable storage (e.g. `123 -> x` then `3*x^2 - 4*x + 5 -> y`)\n* units in equations, and conversion (e.g. `1 inch * 3 ft to cm^2` or `sqrt(60 acre) - 100 ft`)\n* can enter input by button presses, typing, or copy/pasting. Button presses are all converted to plaintext input for easy copy/pasting.\n* equation display is simplified upon pressing enter. This means that when entering an equation, it is usually possible to look only at the LaTeX display and not the plaintext input: but when pressing enter, it will look nice. Redundant brackets are removed, including those that are needed for plaintext input (e.g. `(a + b)/(c + d)` can become \"a + b\" on the numerator and \"c + d\" on the denominator without brackets).\n* light/dark themes\n* previous input history can be accessed and edited by pressing \"up\" or \"down\" buttons.\n* previous inputs/vars/recently used units preserved when the app is closed\n* standard scientific calculator features, such as:\n    * trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan\n    * base 10 and natural logarithmic functions: log (base 10), ln (base e)\n    * `e`, `pi` constants, and square root function\n    * scientific notation input (e.g. `1.23E6` is 1.23 times 10^6)\n","repo":{"author":"Alex Barry","repo":"https://github.com/alexbarry/AlexCalc"},"version":"5c5c666552fb21695d56c5927c48e5aabf802ca1847f221bf841c286a2d12fed","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/alexbarry/AlexCalc","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
