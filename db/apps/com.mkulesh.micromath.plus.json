It is the worldâ€™s first scientific graphing calculator and function plotter on Android oriented around a worksheet. It allows live editing of mathematical identities combined with highly accurate computations.\n\nThe app is 100% open source. Please feel free to download, explore, fork or contribute to it on https://github.com/mkulesh/microMathematics\n\nNot only students, but also everybody who likes mathematics or needs more than just a basic calculator will benefit from this amazing technique of mathematical calculations and plotting.\n\nBenefits and features:\n\n* Maximum privacy: No ads, no trackers, no telemetry, no special permissions\n* The modern Material design supports different color themes and works on smartphones and/or tablets in portrait and landscape mode\n* Verification, validation, documentation and re-use of mathematical calculations\n* Works on smartphone or tablet in portrait and landscape mode\n* Supports all commonly used mathematical operations\n* Mathematical expressions are written in an intuitive and naturally readable form\n* Supports SI and non-SI units (including units of information)\n* Powerful mathematical touch-screen editor with undo function makes editing easier\n* You can do multiple calculations and subsequently correct or change all used formulas\n* It is possible to store intermediate results into 1D, 2D, or 3D array that can improve calculation performance\n* Mathematical expressions are collected in a document, that includes not only formulas and plots, but also additional text and images (SVG format is also supported)\n* You can store your document on SD card and export it into LaTeX format or an image (SD writing permission is needed)\n* SD card on Android 6+ is also supported\n* The app contains detailed \"How to use\" page and several examples\n* Supports data import from ASCII files\n* Supports units of measurements, arrays, complex numbers, functions of many arguments, plots for several functions, contour and 3D plots, summation and product operations, derivative and definite integrals, if-function and logical operators, Fourier transform, root finding.\n\nThis version has following mathematical limitations: it does not support special functions, vectors, matrices and many other things from high-level mathematics.\n\nLanguages: English, Russian, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Spanish","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/mkulesh/microMathematics"},"version":"60ba3e16492ccebc18221c8056c04cda81aa63412e43dbeb5cd6371f95b5c3f3","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mkulesh/microMathematics","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
