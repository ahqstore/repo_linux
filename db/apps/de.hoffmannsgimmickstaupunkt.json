The dew point and the absolute water content of the air are\ncalculated automatically. The dew point tells you, at which temperature of e.g.\nsurfaces, walls or window panes condensation starts.  So: Walls which have a\nlower temperature than what the dew point tells you, get wet! Window panes get\nfogged. Make sure, that humidity is sufficient low and the walls are adequately\nwarm.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Taupunkt"},"version":"7b5582c69e84911cb5ac690d7a8e8f63eedbf2a9a610a6cb00efd6eb130c7a1f","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Taupunkt","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
