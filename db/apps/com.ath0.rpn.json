RPN\ncalculators may be in the minority but they are easy to learn and very\nefficient. The idea is that the operator follows the operands, so that instead\nof typing 2 + 2 =, one types 2 enter 2 enter +. The left arrow either deletes\nthe last digit or drops the last item from the stack. The up arrow show a few\nother functions such as setting the number of decimal points, swapping items on\nthe stack and the use of exponents.","repo":{"author":"ATH0","repo":"https://github.com/lpar/RPN"},"version":"52e1f234710ebdf087e6760d0a0e4ff5d969f142b44ab61d1ce05ff526bd2bda","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/lpar/RPN","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
