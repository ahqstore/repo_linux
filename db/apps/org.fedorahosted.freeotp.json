Tokens can be added easily by scanning a\nQR-code or by manually entering in the token configuration.\n\nFreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side\ncomponent is necessary: use any server-side component that implements these\nstandards - for example <a href=\"http://www.freeipa.org\">FreeIPA</a>, which uses TOTP. Any\nstandards-compliant implementation will work. Currently, FreeOTP provides\nimplementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/freeotp/freeotp-android"},"version":"378bfaa381d8585cf592687cbfed4a47bbf87a6c209a6d5299f95a2211afc212","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/freeotp/freeotp-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
