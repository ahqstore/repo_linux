The main\nidea is to show your device screen during presentations and demos. No need of\nany additional software except for this app and a web browser. No annoying ads\nor pop-ups.\n\nIt uses MJPEG to encode screen images and send them through the network. So it\nworks with any desktop or mobile browser which supports MJPEG (Chrome, Safari,\nEDGE, Firefox).\n\nThe application works via WiFi and/or 3G/LTE network. Fast and stable WiFi\nrecommended because of high traffic and low network delay requirement. No\nInternet required, however, there must be a network connection between the\nclient and the device.\n\nThe number of client connections is unlimited, but be aware that each of them\nrequires some CPU resources and bandwidth to send data.\n\nApplication uses Android Cast feature and requires at least Android 5.0 to run.\n\nWARNING: This is not a real time streaming app. Expected delay is at least 0.5-1\nsecond or more on slow devices, bad WiFi or on heavy CPU load by other apps.\n\nWARNING: This app is not designed for streaming video, especially HD video. Use\nChromecast instead.\n\nWARNING: This app does NOT support SOUND streaming, because MJPEG does not\nsupport sound.\n\nWARNING: Some cell operators may block incoming connections to your device for\nsecurity reasons, so, even if the device has an IP address from a cell operator,\nyou may not be able to connect to the device on using this IP address.\n\nWARNING: Some WiFi networks (mostly public/guest) block connections between its\nclients for security reasons, so you may not be able to connect to the device\nvia WiFi. For example, a laptop and a phone in this such a WiFi network will not\nbe able to connect to each other.","repo":{"author":"Dmitriy Krivoruchko","repo":"https://github.com/dkrivoruchko/ScreenStream"},"version":"8745691849ad548c5259506dde2509aedd12f4509f8ce68c8e520724865b4a64","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/dkrivoruchko/ScreenStream","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
