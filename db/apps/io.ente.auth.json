We use the same protocols Ente Photos uses to encrypt and preserve your data.\n\n- Multi Device Synchronization\nAuth will automatically sync the 2FA tokens you add to your account, across all your devices. Every new device you sign into will have access to these tokens.\n\n- Web access\nYou can access your 2FA code from any web browser by visiting https://auth.ente.io .\n\n- Offline Mode\nAuth generates 2FA tokens offline, so your network connectivity will not get in the way of your workflow.\n\n- Import and Export Tokens\nYou can add tokens to Auth by one of the following methods: \n1. Scanning a QR code\n2. Manually entering (copy-pasting) a 2FA secret\n3. Bulk importing from a file that contains a list of codes in the following format:\n\notpauth://totp/provider.com:you@email.com?secret=YOUR_SECRET\n\nThe codes maybe separated by new lines or commas.\n\nYou can also export the codes you have added to Auth, to an **unencrypted** text file, that adheres to the above format.\n\n\nSUPPORT\n\nIf you need help, please visit @ https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/new?category=q-a, and someone will get in touch with you.\nIf you have feature requests, please create an issue @ https://github.com/ente-io/ente\n","repo":{"author":"ente","repo":"https://github.com/ente-io/ente/"},"version":"9a4c4a47b5630b9ef17e133d6b72fd4963d102549dd07bfc5afb58a180e64105","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ente-io/ente/","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
