In Complica (not like in Connect\nFour), when a piece is placed, it does not remain there for the entire game.\nAnother piece may be used to slide the entire row over. Winner is first person\nto have 4 pieces in a row. The mechanic of the sliding rows means that each\nplayer can possibly have 4 in a row at the same time, causing the game to\ncontinue until this situation can be broken up.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Complica4"},"version":"7d3bcee523829d75889c04da1793af4ea4a9cdd1e70462e764882e5924907fb9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Complica4","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
