All broadcasts will be viewable on media.ccc.de live and as\nrecordings later.\n\nPlease remember that the individual groups are organising these events\nautonomously and are individually responsible for their own content.\n\n<b>Features</b>\n* View program by day and rooms (side by side)\n* Custom grid layout for smartphones (try landscape mode ðŸ™ƒ) and tablets\n* Read detailed descriptions (speaker names, start time, room name, links, ...) of events\n* Add events to favorites list\n* Export favorites list\n* Setup alarms for individual events\n* Add events to your personal calendar\n* Share a website link to an event with others\n* Keep track of program changes\n* Automatic program updates (configurable in settings)\n* Vote and leave comments on talks and workshops\n* Integration with the Engelsystem project <a href=\"https://engelsystem.de\">https://engelsystem.de</a> - Online tool for coordinating helpers and shifts on large events\n* Integration with the Chaosflix <a href=\"https://github.com/NiciDieNase/chaosflix\">https://github.com/NiciDieNase/chaosflix</a> - Android app for <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de\">https://media.ccc.de</a>, share Fahrplan favorites with Chaosflix to import them as bookmarks\n\nðŸ”¤ <b>Supported languages</b>\n(Event descriptions excluded)\n* Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Polish\n* Portuguese\n* Russian\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n\nðŸ’¡ Questions regarding the content can only be answered by the\ncontent teams of the individual events.
