The beatmap directory can also be changed by setting\nthe \"BeatmapDirectory\" value in the generated configuration file.\n\n'''First Run'''\nopsu! will parse all beatmaps when launched, which can take a while for the\nfirst time.  If no beatmaps are found, the game will prompt you to download some\nto get started.\n\nGame settings can be changed in the options menu, accessed by clicking the\n\"Other Options\" button in the song menu.  The \"Music Offset\" value will likely\nneed to be adjusted initially, or whenever hit objects are out of sync with the\nmusic.\n\n'''Directory Structure'''\nThe following files and folders will be created in the opsu folder in storage as needed:\n* `.opsu.cfg`: The configuration file.  Most (but not all) of the settings can\n  be changed through the options menu.\n* `.opsu.db`: The beatmap cache database.\n* `.opsu_scores.db`: The scores and player database.\n* `.opsu.log`: The error log.  All critical errors displayed in-game are also\n  logged to this file, and other warnings not shown are logged as well.\n* `Songs/`: The beatmap directory (not used if an osu! installation is detected).\n  The parser searches all of its subdirectories for .osu files to load.\n* `Skins/`: The skins directory.  Each skin must be placed in a folder within\n  this directory.  Any game resource (in `res/`) can be skinned by placing a\n  file with the same name in a skin folder.  Skins can be selected in the\n  options menu.\n* `Replays/`: The replay directory.  Replays of each completed game are saved\n  as .osr files, and can be viewed at a later time or shared with others.\n* `Import/`: The import directory.  All beatmap packs (.osz) and skin\n  packs (.osk) are unpacked to the proper location.  All replays (.osr) are\n  moved to the replay directory, and their scores saved to the scores database.\n* `Screenshots/`: The screenshot directory. Screenshots can be taken by\n  pressing the F12 key.\n* `Natives/`: The native libraries directory.\n* `Temp/`: The temporary files directory.  Deleted when opsu! exits.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/UnderSampled/opsu"},"version":"ce4dac5f223007fffad2575caf9705b40d3933c7b7d5a1992592951a4936ef6b","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/UnderSampled/opsu","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
