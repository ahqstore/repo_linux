On trigger, using\nDevice Administration API, it locks a device and optionally runs wipe (factory reset). Also it can\nsend a broadcast message instead of the wipe.\n\nAlso you can:\n* fire when a device was not unlocked for X time\n* fire when a USB data connection is made while a device is locked\n* fire when a fake messenger app is launched\n* fire when a duress password is entered (companion app: [Duress](https://github.com/x13a/Duress))\n\nThe app works in Work Profile too, but with limitations. Use it to install risky apps and\nWasted in it. Then you can wipe this profile data with one click without wiping the whole device.\n\nFor base security take a look at: [Sentry](https://github.com/x13a/Sentry).\nOnly encrypted device may guarantee that the data will not be recoverable.\n\nBroadcast:\n* action: me.lucky.wasted.action.TRIGGER\n* receiver: me.lucky.wasted/.TriggerReceiver\n* also you have to send a secret code from Wasted with the key: code\n\nPermissions:\n* DEVICE_ADMIN - lock and optionally wipe a device\n* FOREGROUND_SERVICE - receive lock and USB state events\n* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - persist lock job and foreground service across reboots\n\nIt is Free Open Source Software.\nLicense: GPL-3\n","repo":{"author":"lucky","repo":"https://github.com/x13a/Wasted"},"version":"0e9e27d5c385b6381060157b6ecfca28b030aa2f94b1b84714a6f11902bdb018","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/x13a/Wasted","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
