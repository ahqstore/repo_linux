Have fun asking your friends to figure out what's written. Don't write too much slurs, it's not making it any funnier. Use the gyroscopic feature to select the roll angle if available. Dark theme is enforced but the barcode-text-page is in light theme for contrast purposes. Please consider increasing the screen's brightness if you don't see anything. Some screens work better than others but it should work fine on yours regardless\n","repo":{"author":"Scott Hamilton","repo":"https://github.com/SCOTT-HAMILTON/Trollslate"},"version":"24282aa7dcdc3e1f84c31f662e25c4403b54996cba6524922d07aec9f9d281c4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SCOTT-HAMILTON/Trollslate","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
