Voice can be coded with Opus, AMR, Codec2, G.729, G.722, G.722.1, G.726, or PCMU/PCMA codecs. Security is achieved via TLS or WSS SIP signaling transport and ZRTP or (DTLS) SRTP media encapsulation.\n\nDevelopment of baresip app is motivated by need for a secure, open source SIP based VoIP User Agent for Android that does not depend on proprietary, third party push notification services.\n\nIf you need video calling and have a device with Android version 7.0 or newer that supports Camera2 API at hardware Support Level LEVEL3, you can instead of this application install its sister application baresip+.\n\nSource code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio\">GitHub</a>, where also issues can be reported.\n","repo":{"author":"Juha Heinanen","repo":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio"},"version":"42fbc1eeb4b11862041d95ba378ea0511715df441343450fd3d39e81de7efaef","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
