The Windows edition is also open source and published to: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/ioanm/fissh-windows\">https://gitlab.com/ioanm/fissh-windows</a>.\n\nTo install FiSSH for Windows run the command inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) UBUNTU distro:\n<strong>curl https://gitlab.com/ioanm/fissh-windows/raw/master/Release/install.sh | sudo bash</strong>\n\nThe PC app then returns the received passphrase to OpenSSH and the standard ssh binary completes the login process.\n\nIt is important to note that none of the FiSSH apps have access to private key file and that FiSSH uses TLS sockets with certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks!\n\nSource Code:\nLinux part - <a href=\"https://www.gitlab.com/ioanm/FiSSH-Desktop\">https://www.gitlab.com/ioanm/FiSSH-Desktop</a>\nAndroid app - <a href=\"https://www.gitlab.com/ioanm/FiSSH-App\">https://www.gitlab.com/ioanm/FiSSH-App</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Ioan Moldovan","repo":"https://gitlab.com/ioanm/FiSSH-App"},"version":"fc0a410e5f8bd5f0847089efd1b3cc7a027c2a901f83bf74fb9ce2933ca7e41a","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/ioanm/FiSSH-App","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
