The application presents a list of editable\nphrases, then plays the selected phrase as morse code (or Hellschriber) through\nthe sound output. The audible tones produced may be used directly if a modulated\nsignal is desired, but the sound can also be routed through an easy-to-build\ninterface which converts this sound into on/off keying for the transmitter.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/sussman/androidomatic-keyer"},"version":"5be757726ccb769b066c53b6e2c7dde9b4ae1655dfe86adf889dd1c3ac782c64","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/sussman/androidomatic-keyer","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
