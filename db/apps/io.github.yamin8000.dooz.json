The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal is the winner.\n\nSimple Game AI\n\nCurrently, in hard mode, AI uses a strategy rather than an AI search algorithm like MinMax. This strategy consists of these steps: Win, Block, Fork, Block Fork, Center Play, Corner Play, and Side Play.\nIn Easy difficulty, AI plays a random empty cell in the grid. In Medium difficulty, AI chooses between Easy difficulty and Hard difficulty for each move based on a 50/50 chance.\n\n<b>Strategy's source</b>\nFlexible Strategy Use in Young Children's Tic-Tac-Toe by Kevin Crowley, Robert S.
