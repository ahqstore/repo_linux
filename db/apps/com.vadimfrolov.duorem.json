Imagine\nyour grand parent needs a way to power a media server. Quick and efficiently!\n\nThe application uses Wake On LAN (WOL) technique to start a remote computer. You\nneed to make sure that your computer and network is set up for and support WOL.\nThe app can only power off or restart a Linux-based computer. It performs these\nactions using secure shell (SSH). Your remote computer must be configured to\nenable SSH connections. Username that is used for SSH must have sudo rights.\n\nNote that SSH credentials are stored in application preferences unencrypted!\nAnyone with root access can read it.\n\nDifferences from similar apps\n\n* Supports power off and power on signals.\n* Controls only a single computer.\n* Big interface controls for people with thick fingers.\n* Remote computer status and commands feedback.\n* Host search for easy first-time setup.\n* Open source, no ads.\n\nBug reports and comments are welcomed on app development page.","repo":{"author":"Vadim Frolov","repo":"https://github.com/fralik/Duorem"},"version":"bdba406c2b6573fcaca18eb5a02ba7b1728338f81b430e44214b899b7155602f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/fralik/Duorem","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
