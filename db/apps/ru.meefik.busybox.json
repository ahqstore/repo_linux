It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find\nin GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer\noptions than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are\nincluded provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU\ncounterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or\nembedded system.","repo":{"author":"Anton Skshidlevsky","repo":"https://github.com/meefik/busybox"},"version":"4f86f3c477e59ef5a3d08abe13554d919546dcb3ce4a5e9edfeef042d4b05330","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/meefik/busybox","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
