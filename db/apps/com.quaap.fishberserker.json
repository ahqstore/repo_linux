Just heavy-metal Vikings who love to slice seafood!\n\nSlice all the seafood from entering your Viking ship, but don't chop the anchors! It has two modes, \"Classic\" where you lose a life for each missed food, and \"Arcade\" where you just go for points.\n\nI started this game a long time ago as a joke, but illness and family matters eventually made it so I couldn't finish it. So I just cleaned it up a bit and published it because I'm not sure when I'll get back to it! I hope someone can enjoy it!\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/quaap/SeafoodBerserker"},"version":"9c9b55182ec006e08240e0a22df2eee2d11fdaa8cdc3ba2cca1d7d76aca72b50","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/quaap/SeafoodBerserker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
