They allow you to access your Google account seamlessly and provide Google-specific features for apps that depend on them.\nHowever, when you flash custom ROMs without Google Play Services or opt for alternatives like microG, certain apps may encounter issues — either not functioning at all or experiencing limitations in specific features.\n\nPlexus provides detailed insights into app compatibility whether you’re using ROMs without Google Play Services (like <i>LineageOS</i>) or ROMs with microG (such as <i>CalyxOS</i>). It helps you identify which apps work, don’t work or have limited features.\nAll the information is crowdsourced by the community, for the community.","repo":{"author":"Techlore","repo":"https://github.com/techlore/Plexus-app"},"version":"04d83787c24492a0f7d7de53896076fce6d2850970417eed91e06e19809fadc2","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/techlore/Plexus-app","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
