It has a very rich command set, though it is still easy to learn.\nThe syntax is most similar to GFA-Basic for ATARI-ST. It is a structured dialect\nwith no line numbers. A full manual and command reference is available.\nGFA-programs should run with only a few changes. Also DOS/QBASIC programmers\nwill feel comfortable. This implementation is one of the fastest basic\ninterpreters for Android. Programs can be compiled into a platform independant\nbytecode.\n","repo":{"author":"Markus Hoffmann","repo":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/X11-Basic"},"version":"a9653150b77cee26e658adb6ede3bd3b8070c6ce26969f05592a12ff3586273d","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/X11-Basic","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
