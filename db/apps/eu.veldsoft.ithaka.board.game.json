The pieces are initially arranged so that the three pieces of each\ncolor occupy a corner space and the two adjacent edge spaces.\n\nAll of the pieces are shared by both players. Each player, in turn, moves one\npiece any number of spaces in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line over as\nmany empty spaces as is desired, with the following restrictions:\n\n* The piece moved must not be the same piece moved on your opponent's most recent turn;\n* The piece moved must begin next to a piece of the same color;\n\nWin either by getting three pieces of one color in a row or by leaving your\nopponent with no available moves.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/IthakaBoardGame"},"version":"bac730fdd9e8137def7e56510129a4fd5387deffd4a0b2c9459e19502256449c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/IthakaBoardGame","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
