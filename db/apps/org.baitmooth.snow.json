Snow is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is aiming to be simple with easy recognisable shapes.\n\nSnow includes support for a lot of launchers like Trebuchet, KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more. The installation depends on your launcher, it's probably somewhere in the settings.\n\nSubmitting icon requests helps a lot, but maintaining the project (as you may imagine) takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about adding new icons. Contributions for new icons are always welcome, and no experience with programming is necessary.\n","repo":{"author":"baitmooth","repo":"https://github.com/baitmooth/snow"},"version":"8bc73eafd6a80c1a5d308f674e83ca601950acb7cf32f2e0ff1b6ce8c0cf6caf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/baitmooth/snow","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
