Do you find yourself not reading as much Japanese as you’d like?\n<p>\nThis app will display a notification containing a context sentence from one of your burned (or passed) vocabulary. You read it then you press translate to see if you were right. Right or wrong, the app will display another notification with a random sentence at a configurable interval.\n<p>\nTo ensure notifications are actually displayed remember to disable battery optimization for the app.\n\n• Note that timing of notifications are not exact due to battery saving reasons in Android.\n<p>\nPlease direct any questions and feedback to the thread at the WaniKani forum:\n<a href=\"https://community.wanikani.com/t/android-wanidoku-android-app-to-get-you-to-read-some-context-sentences\">https://community.wanikani.com/t/android-wanidoku-android-app-to-get-you-to-read-some-context-sentences</a>.\n<p>\nSource is provided under GNU GPLv3 license: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/wanidoku\">https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/wanidoku</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/wanidoku"},"version":"81f9c16d632669edfad12c4f35ce7178b1ef5dfaccc13c3b1a66bfd0351aaf56","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/wanidoku","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
