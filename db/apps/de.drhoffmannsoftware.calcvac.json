The pipes can consist of different\nsections of different shape and material. Outgasing of several different\ngas species can be simulated. Also it is possible to install vacuum pumps of\ndifferent types. Also cryo effects (cold pipes and cryo pumps) are\nsimulated. Finally the pipes can be linked together to form a network.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Calcvac-Android"},"version":"7b72770a847009d86e118589aaf52813f544748461ff298fbdceae98f2bc11ca","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Calcvac-Android","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
