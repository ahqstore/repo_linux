Chat with friends and growing communities. Buy, store, and exchange digital assets.\n\nStatus is your Ethereum operating system.\n\nSECURE ETHEREUM WALLET\nThe Status crypto wallet allows you to securely send, store, and exchange Ethereum assets such as ETH, SNT, stable coins such as DAI, as well as collectibles. Confidently take control of your cryptocurrency and digital assets with our multichain Ethereum wallet app, supporting mainnet, Arbitrum, and Optimism. The Status blockchain wallet currently only supports ETH, ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 assets; it does not support Bitcoin.\n\nPRIVATE MESSENGER\nSend private 1:1 and private group chats without anyone snooping on your communications. Status is a messenger app that eliminates centralized message relays for greater privacy and secure messaging. All messages are encrypted with end-to-end encryption. Additionally, no message exposes who the author or the intended recipient is, so nobody, not even Status, knows who is talking to who or what was said.\n\nEARN WITH DEFI\nPut your crypto to work with the latest decentralized finance apps and decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Maker, Aave, Uniswap, Synthetix, PoolTogether, Zerion, Kyber, and more.\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR COMMUNITY\nExplore, connect, and chat with your favorite communities and friends. Whether it is a small group of friends, an artist collective, crypto traders, or the next big organization - text and communicate with Status communities.\n\nPRIVATE ACCOUNT CREATION\nStay private with pseudo-anonymous account creation. When creating your free account, you will NEVER have to enter a phone number, email address, or bank account. Your wallet private keys are locally generated and securely stored to ensure only you have access to your funds and financial transactions.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile"},"version":"ba7bd00731e4e7130b3bb9acdfaa87bd50ab39bf1610f9b9affdd5c3baa6d1ac","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/status-im/status-mobile","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
