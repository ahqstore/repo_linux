Try sync-memories to leverage your deviceâ€™s USB capability.\n\n * Direct transfer via USB\n * Normally, 3-4 times FASTER than Wi-Fi\n * Doesn't block device (phone/tablet) Wi-Fi\n * Skip synched files\n * Avoid redundant copying based on file size so corrupt (incomplete) files are re-transfered on the next sync\n * RAW image files (.ARW) supported\n * RAW files can be stored into separate directory so you can easily handle your backup preferences\n * e.g. send JPEG to Google Photos and send JPEG+RAW to Amazon Prime Photos\n","repo":{"author":"Kei Nakazawa","repo":"https://github.com/muojp/sync-memories"},"version":"68bfaffb73d753a668240eec8d3a47f0bafa67d77a63eb01de23449fe86f0005","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/muojp/sync-memories","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
