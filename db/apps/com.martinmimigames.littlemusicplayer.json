Most importantly it is designed in hope to make it compatible with different Android versions.\nIts usage is as easy as opening or sharing the file you want to play with the app, or selecting it directly from the app. Enjoy your music!\nNote that this project was originally known as simple music player.\n\nCurrently partially support m3u/m3u8 playlist files. More information below in section Playlist Support.\n\nYou can find most information about Little Music Player just below.\n\nDifferent variations\n\n- Tiny Music Player https://github.com/martinmimigames/tiny-music-player\n  Smallest, most minimal, with the trade-off of only having the most basic features.\n\n\nPlaylist support\n\n- Folder-based playlist on Android 5.0+\n- Temporary playlist via multi-share function\n- Partial m3u/m3u8 support\n\nm3u/m3u8 features supported:\n- Audio stream url (http/https)\n- Absolute audio path (e.g. /storage/emulated/0/Music/Example.mp3)\n- Nested m3u/m3u8 files (Absolute path only)\n- Custom audio name via \"#EXTINF: [duration], [custom name]\" , does not support duration\n\nFeatures\n\n- It's free\n  Everyone should have the right to listen to music, therefore we aim to make it accessible.\n\n- No advertisement\n  We simply want a distraction-free experience for you, so you can relax and enjoy!\n\n- Compact\n  Less than half a MB in size, one of the tiniest audio player apps on Android! No need to worry about bloated apps again. (Currently less than 30 KB)\n\n- Unbelievably compatible\n  Strangely addicted to support, we believe that nobody should be excluded due to an older device. Therefore we have theoretical support starting all the way back from Android 1.0, and tested support on Android 2.3 and above. Isn't it amazing?\n\n- Clean & Simple\n  No awkward layout, no hidden options and straightforward, so you can focus on the content. Enjoyment is key, right?\n\n- It simply works :)\n  Even in the modern world, there is always something seeming to fail. Luckily for you, this app was designed to work just like it is supposed to. It supports all audio types that your device supports.\n\n- Minimal permissions required\n  Have you ever met an app asking for a bunch of unrelated permissions? Have you ever had some strange requests reminding you of a malware? Not this app! We will explain how we use all our permissions, so you know it's safe to use.\n\n- No hidden third-parties\n  It is completely open-source, and uses as little third-party libraries as possible.\n\nIf you worry about size, compatibility or privacy, this is the best app for you!\n\nWe use the foreground service permission to provide audio playing while using other apps.\nWe use the notification permission for displaying playback control, as we are mainly a notification\nbased music player.\nWe use the internet permission to allow for audio streaming, however such function is still being\ndeveloped, and can be very buggy.\nWe use the read storage/audio/video permission to open the audio files. Required for older devices, and m3u/m3u8 processing.\n\n(Beta function)\nShare a url containing a media file to Little Music Player to stream it.\nOr use a m3u file with the stream url inside.\n\nIssues\n\nIssues and pull requests are always welcome!\nSince we do not have telemetry in the app, we rely on you to report issues and give feedback.\n\nYou can submit issues the following ways:\n- via Github issues at https://github.com/martinmimigames/little-music-player/issues\n- via email: martinmimigames@gmail.com\n\nMade by Martinmimigames\n\nOfficial website at https://martinmimigames.github.io\n\nLast update of Description:\n- 20-07-2023 dd-mm-yyyy\n\nImportant:\n- Please read the license!","repo":{"author":"martinmimigames","repo":"https://github.com/martinmimigames/little-music-player"},"version":"0d8f33fb6f98e6d4996120848a6f6363b02df8ef01e1b1c04c982454948a3ba2","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/martinmimigames/little-music-player","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
