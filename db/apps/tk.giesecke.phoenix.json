The idea is to restart Android and an application\nperiodically to clean up cache and memory leaks if the application has to run\nover a long time.\n\nAnd if you don't need to restart an application, still this can help to close\nmemory leaks. No background services - reboot is scheduled by system\nAlarmManager. Before reboot is applied, all apps get a shutdown call to save\nthere data. This helps to prevent data loss!\n\nConfiguration allows\n\n* selection of reboot interval from every day to every 30 days\n* selection of reboot time from midnight to 11pm\n* selection between hard reboot (complete restart) or soft/hot reboot (only restart apps)\n* selection if you want to start an app automatically after reboot\n* selection of any app to be started automatically after reboot","repo":{"author":"Bernd Giesecke","repo":"https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/phoenix"},"version":"04084b72d5af321242e7ebd59e56d7cc2d061ed66f882070a9bc740033ebbb11","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/phoenix","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
