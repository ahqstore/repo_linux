It can parse Klingon grammar and serve as an aid in Klingon-to-English translation. However, it is NOT a general-purpose English-to-Klingon translator. You will need to know some Klingon already to make use of it for that purpose.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant-android"},"version":"980b8091be9b92d5f4a513bd04fa98ad868574b68e09ff42af5ca9091aa2d7fb","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
