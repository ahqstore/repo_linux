It supports all of the standard remote control\nfeatures such as play, pause, rewind, volume controls etc. It also has a\nbuilt-in file browser that lets you select what to play. Some typical use-cases\nare people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch,\nor listening to music.\n\nIt also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from the\nphone, similar to a laptop touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the\nphone to the computer). It's great for sitting back on the couch while watching\nyoutube or hulu.\n\nStatus: Version 2.0.7 elsewhere exists but there isn't any source","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://code.google.com/p/gmote/source"},"version":"0c2456bcb7201a6eb0e6a206b4b744fa57d1506b2340035f072fb1c4bca3ee03","site":null,"source":"https://code.google.com/p/gmote/source","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
