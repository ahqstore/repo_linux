With this add-on, you can view all geocaches, you have stored in GSAK, display their listing and more. And all this offline without an internet connection!\n\nIt's easy - install the add-on, copy the database to the smartphone, set the paths correctly, run Locus and just import the geocaches.\n","repo":{"author":"Markus Bubendorf","repo":"https://github.com/bubendorf/LocusAddonGsakDatabase"},"version":"3eae0c6f3334fe6dbb70d3254176108a56c3d3eee3693ef6b7b4e0c648689426","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bubendorf/LocusAddonGsakDatabase","license_or_tos":"WTFPL","resources":null,"verified":false}
