It toggles an internal SharedPreferences flag. If disabled, the service won’t process events even if it’s still enabled in system settings.\n\n    What if I forget my key?\n        You won’t be able to decrypt your text/file. Make sure you keep a record of your keys or store them in the Key Manager.\n\n    Why am I not seeing notifications when copying text?\n        On Android 13+, you must grant the POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission.\n        Check that the accessibility service is enabled and the internal logic is not toggled off.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/R00tedbrain/Encrypt-Decrypt-AndroidAPK"},"version":"fa4b9b2ef2a0460c9dfd58af8f387ef4934cb0c91d5446993c97a21a6c67291b","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/R00tedbrain/Encrypt-Decrypt-AndroidAPK","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
