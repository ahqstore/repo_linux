Vibrating continuously is a quick way to drain your battery.\n\n<strong>What else can you use this app for?</strong>\n\nThe potential uses of this app are limitless. If you're sick of calibrating batteries, here are some other ideas:\n- Make music! Listen to the smoothing sounds of your Androids vibrating in harmony\n- Play pranks! Hide your vibrating device in the wardrobe and tell your partner there's a wasp in the house\n- Vibe check! Invite all your friends around and throughly vibe check them\n","repo":{"author":"Luke Needham","repo":"https://github.com/LukeNeedham/Vibrator"},"version":"5910785fc3affd494d0aa9325c74cdf31293c46a0c91c918b026e334349ee51e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/LukeNeedham/Vibrator","license_or_tos":"CC0-1.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
