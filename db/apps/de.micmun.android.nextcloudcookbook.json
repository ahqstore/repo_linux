Perhaps at next app start no recipes can be loaded.\nTherefore it is better to use the above mentioned path on the SD card (see First steps).\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/MicMun/nextcloud-cookbook"},"version":"e6eec9c6527703ca21ec9820adebcbdd3486a7b1443942aff38e4c63ba65f785","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/MicMun/nextcloud-cookbook","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
