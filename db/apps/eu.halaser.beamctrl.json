It can be used to watch the production/building state of one\napplication or of several machine within a complete production line.\n\nThe application can be configured to connect to an nearly unlimited number\nof software instances. Then it watches their current production state and\nnotifies the user as soon as something changes or when an event occurs,\nthat requires manual interaction. Thus one operator can control a complete\nproduction line easily.\n\nThis application also acts as demonstration for the Smart Factory (Industry\n4.0) interface which also can be used to integrate these applications in an\nautomated production line. The sources of this application are available\nfor free and can be used to implement own Smart Factory solutions.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://sourceforge.net/p/oapc/code/ci/master/tree/AndroidBeamControl"},"version":"f7cbb493c0dc3bc307e507bfc0a9766cb8088229f00ef727088dd34e1ec2aa21","site":null,"source":"https://sourceforge.net/p/oapc/code/ci/master/tree/AndroidBeamControl","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
