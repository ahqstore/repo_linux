No need to press the lock button anymore.\nIf you do not have a flap cover, then merely putting the mobile into your pocket\nwill lock the screen. Also you can specify to disable the app while a call is in\nprogress. Time can be set for which the app will remain disabled once you unlock\nthe screen. This avoids unwanted locking. By switching off the screen you save\nthe battery, too.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/f2l-flap-2-lock/f2l-flap-2-lock"},"version":"839dd07a7158d87f58e21a64b554536d1bb5efcf2242e2dc1e43ca374d492d78","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/f2l-flap-2-lock/f2l-flap-2-lock","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
