The app will open showing the compression progress and when it's done a new share dialog will reappear with the new compressed file.\n\n<b>Split APKs</b>\nThe APK downloaded from F-Droid is the app full version with all features and abi compatibility included. A choice of smaller APKs can be found at https://github.com/caydey/ffshare/releases\n\n<b>Source Code</b>\nThis app is open source and hosted on GitHub. A star would be greatly appreciated.\nhttps://github.com/caydey/ffshare\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/caydey/ffshare"},"version":"97e1eb5b046f3d4bac83a5935afd6fb9595866f5136925041ef817c0cc06fe53","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/caydey/ffshare","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
