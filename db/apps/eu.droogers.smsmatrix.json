For every (new) text\nconversation contact the bot will open a private 1:1 room and sends the\nincoming messages to that room. Any messages sent in that room by the\nmatrix user will then be sent to the contact via SMS.\n\nAs currently there is no end-to-end encryption implemented in this app, for\nprivacy reasons it is preferable to use it with your own Matrix server.\nYour data-in-transit however will always be safe as they are encrypted\nusing https over matrix -- provided the Matrix server is configured\nproperly.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix"},"version":"728c35b687316efaec204509444ff37b0f14a2fb1156ef6573266427a7618bd4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
