It uses a rolling time frame: price is\nfetched with a given update interval (e.g. 30 s) and compared with the price\nfetched one time frame ago (e.g. 15 min ago).\n\nSound and vibration are configurable globally, and individually for each alarm.\nLists of exchanges, pairs and alarms are fully searchable, allowing quick setup\nand configuration. The alarm list behaves as your ticker, where you can reorder\nyour alarms and directly change their limits. Triggered alarms ring, displaying\ntheir status, until you turn them off. Just like an alarm clock. Alarms can also\nbe set to snooze automatically on price retrace. Market data is retrieved\ndirectly from the exchanges via Wi-Fi or Mobile Data (if allowed).\n\nBoilr supports all <a href=\"https://github.com/drpout/libdynticker/#supported-exchanges\nexchanges\">available on libdynticker</a>, as all their pairs.\n\nFor a version history check the <a href=\"https://github.com/drpout/boilr/releases\">GitHub\nreleases page</a>.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/drpout/boilr"},"version":"d726effb18e3ef50340dd9d4019565895808e492ff1d57f6e50fee9c9eff3b44","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/drpout/boilr","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
