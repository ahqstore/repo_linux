Possible changes include:\n\n* maximum of operands or result,\n* integer or decimal (with up to four decimal places) operations,\n* with or without carry over,\n* multiplication and addition tables training,\n* number of authorized tries,\n* and some few others...\n\nThe program also gives hints when the given answer is wrong (send your tips to\nthe author, if you have some more!). For advanced users, there is a timer -- but\nit is shut-off by default, as to not stress sensible children.\n\nThe challenge mode (reachable from the menu in the first dialog) allows children\nto play against themselves and others with predefined challenges and a\nhigh-scores list.\n\nFinally, the language of the app can be set differently (English, French,\nGerman, Italian, Spanish) from the system default.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/ericzolf/pmtd"},"version":"1cfc931835289fe313d45c082573db08048af1668711a64f18a64c4db6aad365","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ericzolf/pmtd","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
