Developers are free to add more search engines.\n\nTo use Gugal with Google Search you need a CSE ID and API key. Instructions for obtaining both can be found in the app. <b>To get these you have to have a Google account, therefore Google might still link searches to your account. If you want to use a search engine that respects your privacy more, use Gugal with a searx/SearXNG instance.</b>\n\n<i>Google and Google Search are trademarks of Google LLC.</i>\n","repo":{"author":"Narek","repo":"https://gitlab.com/narektor/gugal"},"version":"3d3cbdd5236d1909fde91996ff89052f3c9f37a1762e44525956ad34f9e381c9","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/narektor/gugal","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
