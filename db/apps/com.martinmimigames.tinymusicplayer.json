Most importantly it is designed in hope to make it compatible with different Android versions.\nIts usage is as easy as opening or sharing the file you want to play with the app, or selecting it directly from the app. Enjoy your music!\nThis project is a branch from Little Music Player, but intended to be as small as possible, with only basic function.\n\nYou can find most information about Tiny Music Player just below.\n\nNotices\n\nThe app will not be able to function properly without notification permissions being granted.\nFor Android 13+, due to new notification restrictions, the app will bring you to the settings page if the permission is not granted.\n\nFeatures\n\n- It's free\n  Everyone should have the right to listen to music, therefore we aim to make it accessible.\n\n- No advertisement\n  We simply want a distraction-free experience for you, so you can relax and enjoy!\n\n- Compact\n  Less than 20 kB in size, one of the tiniest audio player apps on Android! No need to worry about bloated apps again.\n\n- Unbelievably compatible\n  Strangely addicted to support, we believe that nobody should be excluded due to an older device. Therefore we have theoretical support starting all the way back from Android 1.0, and tested support on Android 2.3 and above. Isn't it amazing?\n\n- Clean & Simple\n  No awkward layout, no hidden options and straightforward, so you can focus on the content. Enjoyment is key, right?\n\n- It simply works :)\n  Even in the modern world, there is always something seeming to fail. Luckily for you, this app was designed to work just like it is supposed to. It supports all audio types that your device supports.\n\n- Minimal permissions required\n  Have you ever met an app asking for a bunch of unrelated permissions? Have you ever had some strange requests reminding you of a malware? **Not this app!** The only 3 required permissions are notification, foreground service and read storage permission, so you know it's safe to use.\n\n- No hidden third-parties\n  It is completely open-source, and uses as little third-party libraries as possible.\n\nIf you worry about size, compatibility or privacy, this is the best app for you!\n\nWe use the foreground service permission to provide audio playing while using other apps.\nwe use the notification permission to provide playback control for audio playing.\nWe use the read storage permission on older devices to open the audio files. (not required for newer devices)\n\nIssues and pull requests are always welcome!\n\nLast update of Description:\n- 27-01-2023 dd-mm-yyyy\n\nImportant:\n- Please read the license!","repo":{"author":"martinmimigames","repo":"https://github.com/martinmimigames/tiny-music-player"},"version":"d7bcb24d101b04beb3394b695b24be4e2c3d6ed702f1d0e06bc4dd707f64d86a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/martinmimigames/tiny-music-player","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
