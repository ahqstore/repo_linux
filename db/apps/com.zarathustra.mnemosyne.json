One can also export lists to save elsewhere.\n\nThere is a feature that allows for placing related lists together in a collapsible group.\nOne can nest these groups to near arbitrary depth. One creates a group by prefixing the group title to the list title, followed by \"::\".\nFor example, to create a grouping of German lists, where one wants a list of nouns and a list of verbs, one would name the two lists German::Nouns and German::Verbs.\n","repo":{"author":"Santiago Orellana","repo":"https://github.com/aptaabye/Mnemosyne"},"version":"7e3e657f5782cdaf4b5eacef6d5831543f31685de9f3b629241c36fa2fbaf913","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/aptaabye/Mnemosyne","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
