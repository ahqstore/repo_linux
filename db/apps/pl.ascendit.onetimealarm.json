After alarm is fired it is deleted, it doesn't have to be deleted manually as in normal alarm application.\n\nREAD BEFORE USE!\nIn this app it's only possible to set alarms which don't repeat and only for today or tomorrow!\nDon't expect this app to be used as a replacement for your standard alarm app or calendar! \nIt's a different type of application! It is not a calendar or standard alarm clock app.\n\n","repo":{"author":"matdlu","repo":"https://github.com/matdlu/OneTimeAlarm"},"version":"77fd4aa9d4f2cbbd65de3783047d6ddc8f80fca76730b6d09bf230d34a625aeb","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/matdlu/OneTimeAlarm","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
