It is meant to check calculations and takes part in the interactive lectures.\n\nPlease be advised that the whole application is in german only. If you are an optician it is highly possible that you will understand most of the functions by their formula symbols.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/HS_Aalen_RN/Aalener_Optik-Formelrechner"},"version":"bad6f886478eb8e3c75059b6dc85e8fddcca6ae8d13d767d7954d13d07477039","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/HS_Aalen_RN/Aalener_Optik-Formelrechner","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
