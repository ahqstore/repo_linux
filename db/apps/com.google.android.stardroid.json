Use it to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more. Originally developed as Google Sky Map, it has now been donated and open sourced.\n\n<b>Troubleshooting/FAQ</b>\n\n<i>The Map doesn't move/points in the wrong place</i>\nMake sure you haven't switched into manual mode. Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up here: http://www.gsmarena.com/\n\nTry calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI.\n\nAre there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass?\n\nTry switching off \"magnetic correction\" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.\n\n<i>Why is autolocation not supported for my phone?</i>\nIn Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described here: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m\n\n<i>The Map is jittery</i>\nTry adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings). We have a better solution coming soon!\n\n<i>Do I need an internet connection?</i>\nNo, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one. You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.\n\n<b>Find us elsewhere:</b>\n⭐ GitHub: https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid\n⭐ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/113507592330/\n⭐ Twitter: http://twitter.com/skymapdevs\n","repo":{"author":"Sky Map Devs","repo":"https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid"},"version":"5bbe586e631adc2761c38ba1fed7553b78da67e291a8991884628fc85ad0b10c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
