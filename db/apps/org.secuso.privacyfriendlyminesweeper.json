If that field contains a mine it is triggered\nand the game is lost. Otherwise the field will show a number. That number will tell\nyou the amount of mines in the surreounding 8 fields. With that information and logical\nthinking the mines can be located and marked.\n\nThe first field you click each game will not ba a mine. Each game will have a new\nplaying field with randomzed poisitioning of mines, so each game will be a new experience.\nWhile the mines are mostly positioned randomly the first field clicked each game will not\nhave a mine, and four or more mines in adjacent fields will be avoided, since such clusters\nincrease the chance of situations that must me solved by guessing.\n\nThere are three different gamemodes represinting three difficulties. They differ in\nplaying field size and the amount of mines:\n\n* 6x10 Playing Field with 7 Mines\n* 10x16 Playing Field with 24 Mines\n* 12x19 Playing Field with 46 Mines\n\nIn addition there is the option to create your own gamemode where the size of the playing\nfield (amount of rows and columns) and the proportion of mines (easy / medium / hard).\n\nUp to 10 games can be saved and later continued. Your Performance for the three basic\ngamemodes is collected and analyzed and can be viewed at the statistic page. There you\ncan check the number of games played, the ratio of won games, the average time of winning\ngames, the number of revealed fields and the 10 best times for each gamemode.\n\nThe app belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research\ngroup SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\n","repo":{"author":"SECUSO - Security Usability Society","repo":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-minesweeper"},"version":"45be179222e81795ad28e739a33a272a9b1f0f186ab81a3eea56f0fa891805dc","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-minesweeper","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
