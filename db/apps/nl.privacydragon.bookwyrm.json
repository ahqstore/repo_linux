It is just BookWyrm put into a webview element, nothing special – but it adds some convenience on top:\n\n* bookwyrm links can be made to open with the app (e.g. clicking on the link to someone's userprofile will open that from your own bookwyrm instance)\n* thanks to that, you can immediately follow them easily if you want.\n* it lets you easily return to your own home timeline when viewing something like posts, on another bookwyrm instance, because the 'back' button is then modified for that.\n* You can also search for books by scanning the ISBN, no matter what instance of Bookwyrm you use.\n\n<b>This application is <u>not</u> an official client!</b> (An official client does not exist yet, as far as I know)\n\nThe ISBN scanning feature is created with the zxing-android-embedded library.\n","repo":{"author":"Privacy_Dragon","repo":"https://github.com/PrivacyDragon/Bookwyrm_Android"},"version":"58a8d9d06d232675bfaa4619facd9047d2ba9507638a60200e306ba4ccab9860","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/PrivacyDragon/Bookwyrm_Android","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
