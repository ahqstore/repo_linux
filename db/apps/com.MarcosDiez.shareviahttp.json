Just share the\nitem via the Share Menu and a mini web server will be started allowing others to\ndownload the file. If there are multiple files a zip archive will be created on\nthe fly. If https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.zxing.client.android is installed a QR code can be\nproduced with the URL. It will only work if the recipient is on the same LAN if\nyou use WiFI but should work anywhere if you use GSM (2G/3G), though more\nslowly. The server can be stopped at any time from the screen that shows the URL\n(press the back button if you're on the barcode).","repo":{"author":"Marcos Diez","repo":"https://github.com/marcosdiez/shareviahttp"},"version":"4309ff8e85b9bdab0144fb6330fcb80f0e09f8b96926c7fb3bcc9aa2154d9d18","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/marcosdiez/shareviahttp","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
