To connect to an external VNC, you\ncan use https://f-droid.org/packages/com.coboltforge.dontmind.multivnc or https://f-droid.org/packages/android.androidVNC\nclients available in F-Droid.\n\nOn android devices with x86-based CPU (Intel Atom), Limbo can run with\nKVM mode, allowing for much better perfomance.\n\nKeep in mind, limbo is a complete emulation of another CPU architecture,\nso you most likely won't be able to run modern operating systems\nwith reasonable perfomance.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/limboemu/limbo"},"version":"b85ae2ed1963104b03e1e29581f4bccd4163818208dbcbcb427b5168b495efaf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/limboemu/limbo","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
