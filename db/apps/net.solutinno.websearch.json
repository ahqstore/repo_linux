You can import engines from an\nurl, or you can add new engines by hand: for examples, see OpenSearch engines\nfrom <a href=\"http://mycroftproject.com\">Mycroft project</a> and\n<a href=\"http://www.searchplugins.net\">SearchPlugins</a>.\n\nIf you tap the import icon on the action bar, a dialog will appear. You have to\nfill the url edit box, then tap the import button. You have to fill in at least\nthe name and the url fields.
