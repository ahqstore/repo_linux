You get home from the hospital, exhausted, with this little fragile unknown thingy that has no user manual and a single way to let you know something's not ok: crying.\nYou have to react fast, even if it's 4 AM and you have no idea why is crying.\n\nThis app is meant to log all the relevant events (diaper change, breastfeeding, baby bottle feeding...), so you can always remember when has been done last time. It supports syncing the data between different devices (using your WebDAV server for the best privacy) so that when the baby needs attentions, the dad can step in leaving the mom sleeping peacefully.\n\nDedicated to my daughter Luna.\n\n\n\nNOTE: the content on this app is for informational or educational purposes only and does not substitute professional medical advice or consultations with healthcare professionals.\nFeature graphic (\"Baby and baby milk bottle.
