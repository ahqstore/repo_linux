A version of the application that is completely open source is available from F-Droid.</p>\n<p>Both versions are available from the <a href=\"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/releases\">Releases section</a> of the GitHub repository.</p>\n<b>Documentation</b>\n<p>The app&#39;s documentation is available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/blob/master/HELP.md\">HELP.md file</a>.</p>\n<b>License</b>\n<p>VoIP.ms SMS is licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache License 2.0</a>.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Michael Kourlas","repo":"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client"},"version":"88363105eea34e0e27bd99e5571f9d377b9c404c12f583189d50d6d459137ee0","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
