On such phones you will only see one cell under \"GSM\" or \"CDMA\". This is a limitation of the phone's radio firmware, and SatStat has no way of getting more information from the device.\n* Some devices ignore the command to refresh AGPS data. This is a limitation of the GPS driver (which varies from device to device and is usually proprietary). Starting with version 2.0, SatStat has a workaround in place for automatic AGPS updates.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/mvglasow/satstat"},"version":"7caa3c57baaacbbbf5dc6ef62c62bae92495bd6d1ab318ba07f4fe1338b08b04","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/mvglasow/satstat","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
