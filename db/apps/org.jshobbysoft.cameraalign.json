This allows the phone to be positioned in the same location and orientation as when the original picture was taken.  \n\nCurrently I use this app as a quick way to align the antennas for my software defined radios with a fixed point, but there can be other uses as well.  \n\nThis app also has the capability to select a certain color to be transparent for \"green screen\" style overlays.  The transparency can be applied to the image or the live camera preview.  \n\nThis app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.  \n\nSource code is available on GitHub: JS-HobbySoft/CameraAlign  \n\nThe source code is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.  \n\nThe app icon was created with Stable Diffusion.\n\n","repo":{"author":"JS Hobby Soft","repo":"https://github.com/JS-HobbySoft/CameraAlign"},"version":"857c5fab6fb61c2a4f026082f2901931a666d36d16f8e05902424df542b190fa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/JS-HobbySoft/CameraAlign","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
