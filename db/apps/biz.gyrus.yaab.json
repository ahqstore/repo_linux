Of course HTC Sense on\nDesire has auto brightness feature, but average brightness level set by Sense is\npretty much higher than needed for comfortable work. For people who use their\ndevices for reading books, emails, texting, etc. this kind of application would\nallow to save up to 30% of battery. The website has a full explanation of the\nideas behind the operation.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://bitbucket-archive.softwareheritage.org/projects/gy/gyrussolutions/yaab.html"},"version":"d9c075c8cace1af1a6cdb825da8e19c7442c2060f7181d6132a60c06194b543d","site":null,"source":"https://bitbucket-archive.softwareheritage.org/projects/gy/gyrussolutions/yaab.html","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
