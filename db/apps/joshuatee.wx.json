This weather app is not affiliated with NOAA or the National Weather Service.\n\nIf you *only* need current conditions and your local 7 day forecast then this app is probably more then you need although it will easily provide those 2 things as well. If you are looking for wasted screen real estate or fancy graphics this app is not for you.
