It should reduce your screen time from opening apps you didn't plan on opening.\n  \n  Would recommend using a grey or black wallpaper (for immersion?, idk just recommending)\n\n  FEATURES\n  * No ads\n  * FOSS forever\n  * Clean, fast and lightweight\n\n  HOW TO USE\n  * Swipe up to see all the apps and quick search\n  * Swipe down for notification drawer\n  * Long press home apps to change them\n  * <b>Important</b>: Long press on empty space to open settings\n  Once you open the settings, you'll see all the available options.\n  So basically, swipe and long press anywhere and you'll be fine.\n","repo":{"author":"MLM Games","repo":"https://github.com/mlm-games/CLauncher"},"version":"39d696003e210bb46a7e36b71dd8b52e9e76b7a97a64d36f143d2c91c1a20a42","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mlm-games/CLauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
