This can be frustrating to users if\nthey want to use a different app to handle these button presses on their\nBluetooth devices.\n\nThis app attempts to alleviate these pains by providing hands-free selection of\nthe app you want to use to handle media buttons through text-to-speech and use\nof the previous, next, and play buttons for selection.","repo":{"author":"Harleen Sahni","repo":"https://github.com/harleensahni/media-button-router"},"version":"c462675a7690291b77d21ef72f3ea1f51184e2d2781e5d87c2d250ce3e069509","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/harleensahni/media-button-router","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
