You'll import a POI list and it'll start an\nalways-on-top widget displaying the closest POI and alerting you if you don't\nfollow the POI requirements.  All the parameters are configurable; minimal\ndistance to warn, allowed over-speed, whether to automatically start when your\ncar's Bluetooth is connected, or to log your track.\n\nDepending on your country's law, you can also limit to range alert (instead of\nexact position alert).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/X-Ryl669/BwareArea"},"version":"2c043e3eac8a974158b52c79d070c5099ec9da7f7c932fe8a5b008c1c2eb3094","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/X-Ryl669/BwareArea","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
