For this reason, in this game you are given the ability to write down relational patterns between cells, and delegate the boring work to the game engine. Your job remains to stay ahead of your own thoughts and to ensure the consistency of your own defined rules.\n","repo":{"author":"theoden8","repo":"https://codeberg.org/theoden8/sudaku"},"version":"c415038535c9ec978c6de1be9c463e47ca5f6a10a088bd2095fb12a02f087cac","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/theoden8/sudaku","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
