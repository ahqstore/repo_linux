Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%.\nThis principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.\n\nDefine levels of your final habit, going from easy to hard. Then start with the first one. Level up by consistently succeeding. If a level is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the previous one.\n\nSuch a gradual acquisition <b>reduces the physical/mental strain</b> and helps you <b>create a routine long before arriving at the final habit</b>.\n\n\n<strong>Example of a Habit-Plan:</strong>\nFinal Habit: <i>Go jogging every morning</i>\nLevels: <i>Every morning...</i>\n<b>* Week 1:</b> Just step outside on the street, then return home.\n<b>* Week 2:</b> Take a walk around your house/building.\n<b>* Week 3:</b> Take a walk spanning 3-5 buildings.\n<b>* Week 4:</b> Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix.\n<b>* Week 5:</b> Go jogging. Well done.\n\n\n<b>Permissions</b>\nPermissions are only used to display notifications.","repo":{"author":"Glitchy-Tozier","repo":"https://github.com/Glitchy-Tozier/githo"},"version":"7f1f86ebcece398d3a806de19cdac579a8f69f4ea03f53c6a86116b8899e6b5d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Glitchy-Tozier/githo","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
