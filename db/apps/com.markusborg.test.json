Moving to the various corners of the court improves\nboth footwork and general stamina. In the best of worlds, your coach or sparring\npartner will always be ready to point you to random corners at a pace that\npushes you to your limits.\n\nUnfortunately, few people have access to a coach at all times, thus have to run\nthe exercise on their own. That means the randomness in the order of corners is\nmissing.\n\nGetting Started\n\n1. Configure your ghosting session. 2. Put your mobile device in front of you on\nthe court. 3. Press \"GO!\" to start your ghosting session.","repo":{"author":"Markus Borg","repo":"https://github.com/mrksbrg/RacketGhost"},"version":"17004efb88a35ec9ebc2b503f6e94a0597a566bff9516cb91919d8820ff6508f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mrksbrg/RacketGhost","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
