Just go to a mall, and start Every Door. You'll see mapped shops around you: tap on the checkmark for any that are still there, and add shops that are not on the map. That's the entire process: you can keep your entire town up-to-date thanks to this simple editor.\n\nThere is also a micromapping mode for verifying and adding benches and street lamps. And an entrance mode for adding building attributes and entrances — which are merged automatically into building contours.\n\nEvery Door uses presets and other data from iD editor.\n","repo":{"author":"Ilya Zverev","repo":"https://github.com/Zverik/every_door"},"version":"f04e1f0b53c3ecbe3fd51a2765c6ead6927a7c0cb5bba6c71fd928e48c6247a3","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Zverik/every_door","license_or_tos":"ISC","resources":null,"verified":false}
