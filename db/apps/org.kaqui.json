It includes multiple\ntests to memorize hiragana, katakana, and kanji and adapts to the user's\nlearning pace.\n\nOne of the biggest difficulty with learning Japanese is memorizing kanji\nand vocabulary. While learning them by just reading and writing them\neveryday may work, the more kanji you know, the harder it gets and the more\ntime it takes to revise them all. Proper tools can help you memorize these\nhuge amounts of knowledge to more quickly become a fluent Japanese speaker.\n\nKakugo is one of these tools. It helps learning and revising kanji and\nvocabulary in an efficient manner. It uses Spaced Repetition in a unique\nway that adapts to the user's pace.

There is no \"kanji of the day\" list to revise, you can\nstart and finish a session whenever you feel like it.\n\nKakugo also features a wide variety of tests to help you find the best ways\nthat will help you learn Japanese.\n\n<b>Features include</b>\n\n* Hiragana, Katakana quizzes\n* Kanji quizzes by reading and meaning\n* Kanji test by part composition\n* Kanji writing test\n* Vocabulary quizzes by reading and meaning\n* Unique spaced repetition formula that adapts to your own learning pace\n* Unlimited quiz sessions that allow you to take a quiz at any time, for however long you want, useful to efficiently spend commuting time\n* Show similar-looking kanji in answers to teach you the differences\n* Kanji and vocabulary sorted by JLPT level\n* Clicking on kanji opens <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.baka.aedict3\">aedict3</a> (a non-free Japanese dictionary) or <a href=\"https://jisho.org\">jisho.org</a>\n* Optimized tablet support\n* Open source\n* No ads\n* No internet access required\n* Supported languages: English, French\n* More to come\n\n<b>Credits</b>\n\n* The kanji quizzes are based on <a href=\"http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjidic.html\">kanjidic</a>.\n* The vocabulary quizzes are based on <a href=\"http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html\">JMdict</a>.\n* The kanji similarity database comes from https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/35336 and http://lars.yencken.org/datasets/phd/\n* The kanji composition and drawing database comes from <a href=\"https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/\">KanjiVG</a>.","repo":{"author":"Philippe Daouadi","repo":"https://github.com/blastrock/kakugo"},"version":"ff861950ddcb35ce0a41ef6616e738c12fbac559aefdadab346ea636a9e54a61","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/blastrock/kakugo","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
